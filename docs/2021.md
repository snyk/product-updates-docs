## Improved scanning of Java applications in Container images

December 28, 2021

**Improved**

We‚Äôre pleased to announce an improved scanning of Java applications in Snyk Container, allowing developers to find vulnerabilities in nested and shaded jars within their images.

You can use one of the following to scan images using Snyk:

* Using the `snyk container test/monitor --app-vulns` command in the Snyk CLI
* Importing an image using a container registry
* Using the kubernetes integration When using one of the above, Snyk will find vulnerabilities in application dependencies from container images, as well as from operating systems.

For Java applications, Snyk also scans one level of nested jars (including shaded jars) by default.

For more information, check out [Detecting application vulnerabilities in container images](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/getting-around-the-snyk-container-ui/detecting-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images).

## CLI Log4Shell command

December 18, 2021

**New**

We have enhanced the Snyk CLI with a new **snyk log4shell** command that will give you more visibility into your application, including being able to find traces of the vulnerable library even if it‚Äôs not declared in the manifest file.

The new command looks inside .jar and .war files to find Log4j or its parts. ‚ÄúFat JARs‚Äù are supported as well.

With **snyk log4shell** you can scan a Java project to see if it includes:

* any .jar files with the vulnerable version of Log4j.
* any files known to be present in the vulnerable Log4j library. Such findings indicate that the whole Log4j library may be included.

**Note**: The new command does not require (or support) any additional command-line arguments.

For more details of using this command, see [Find Log4Shell vulnerabilities in your unmanaged and shaded jars with the Snyk CLI](https://snyk.io/blog/new-snyk-cli-command-finds-log4shell-in-unmanaged-undeclared-java-code/).

See our [Snyk CLI docs](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli) for more information.

## Log4j vulnerability notice

December 13, 2021

**New**

On December 10, 2021, a new, critical [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) vulnerability was disclosed: [Log4Shell](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/apple-icloud-twitter-and-minecraft-vulnerable-to-ubiquitous-zero-day-exploit/). This vulnerability within the popular Java logging framework was published as [CVE-2021-44228](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHELOGGINGLOG4J-2314720), categorized as **Critical** with a CVSS score of 10 (the highest score possible).

All current versions of log4j2 up to 2.14.1 are vulnerable. You can remediate this vulnerability by updating to [version 2.15.0 or later](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html).

Many application frameworks in the Java ecosystem use this logging framework by default. For instance, Apache Struts 2, Apache Solr, and Apache Druid are all affected. Aside from those, Apache log4j is also used in many Spring and Spring Boot applications, so we suggest you check your applications and update them to the latest version.

Read more in our blog post: [Log4j vulnerability disclosed: Prevent Log4Shell RCE by updating to version 2.15.0](https://snyk.io/blog/log4j-rce-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-4428/)

## Container Security Data Improvements

December 13, 2021

**Improved**

We would like to inform you about upcoming changes to how we provide security data and evaluate the severity of container vulnerabilities.

**CentOS Linux and CentOS Stream Updates**:

As part of a continual effort to improve our container security data, we are changing how we provide information regarding CentOS Linux 6, 7 & 8 and CentOS Stream 8 vulnerabilities. Prior to these changes, we only provided information about CentOS through Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA), which are collections of fixed CVEs. We are moving from presenting issues via RHSA, and instead will present them based on the individual CVEs, both fixed and unfixed.

The following are some of the key features of this change:

* **Enhanced accuracy**: By showing individual CVEs instead of an RHSA, which may cover more than one CVE, you will have more details about each vulnerability that Snyk detects.
* **Broader coverage**: We will now show both fixed and unfixed CVEs, whereas the RHSA only shows fixed CVEs.
* **Enriched metadata**: Showing individual CVEs allows us to provide enriched vulnerability metadata on these CVEs, like Exploit Maturity, Social Trends and more.
* **Red Hat‚Äôs security analysis**: We will provide the severity of the issues as defined by the Red Hat Security Team, in addition to the severity determined by NVD, as part of the Relative Importance feature.

Important note: The number of issues will increase significantly as a result of the change, so you might see a change in the number of issues in the reports.

**Red Hat CVSS score for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS**:

For vulnerabilities that the Red Hat security team has evaluated and assigned a CVSS score, we are moving to use Red Hat's score as the default score we will present (when available) as it better reflects how a vulnerability affects their products.

Important note: There may be some changes to existing vulnerabilities in your projects, such as moving CVSS score from 5.6 to 8.8.

**Debian, Alpine, and Ubuntu Severity Updates**:

We improved the way we evaluate risk for Debian, Alpine and Ubuntu vulnerabilities, by creating a smarter logic for combining the Linux source severity data and NVD severity data. In this on-going process to enhance accuracy, we are updating the severity of selected vulnerabilities.

Important note: This means that there may be some changes to existing vulnerabilities in your projects, such as moving from Low severity to High severity.

The rollout of the aforementioned changes will start on **December 15th**. Once the new data will be available, the old data will not be available.

After the change, retesting of the project is required (either a manual test or scheduled scanning for monitored projects).

## C/C++ Beta Support in Snyk Open Source

December 8, 2021

**Open beta**

We're pleased to announce the beta of C/C++ support in Snyk Open Source! üéâ

With this new support, you can scan your C/C++ projects using the Snyk CLI to identify known vulnerabilities in the open source code you are using to build your applications.

This is our first step towards supporting the scanning of unmanaged source code, without relying on package manifests. The `snyk unmanaged test` in the Snyk CLI scans your source code for included open source dependencies and reports their vulnerabilities.

Using the `snyk unmanaged monitor` command, you can import the information about your dependencies into Snyk UI for reporting purposes. These capabilities are available, in beta, across all of Snyk's paid plans: Team, Business, and Enterprise. To join the beta, please drop us a note at [ccpp-beta@snyk.io](mailto:ccpp-beta@snyk.io) so we can verify your specific use case is supported. More information about these capabilities and how to use them are available in our [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-c-c++).

***

## Snyk Open Source in Visual Studio Code

November 23, 2021

**New**

We‚Äôre pleased to announce our new extension for Visual Studio Code, making it easier for developers to find and fix security issues as they code! Within seconds, the extension provides a list of all the different types of issues identified, in categories:

* Open source security - known vulnerabilities in both the direct and in-direct (transitive) open source dependencies you are pulling into the project.
* Code Security - security weaknesses identified in your own code.
* Code Quality - code quality issues in your own code.

The extension is easy to install just like any other Visual Studio Code extension, directly from within your IDE or from the [Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner). Beneath the surface the powerful Snyk AI engine ensures both the speed of executed scans as well as the accuracy of results, guaranteeing an extremely fast feedback loop for developers.

For further details, please have a look at the [product documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/features/integrations/ide-tools/visual-studio-code-extension-for-snyk-code).

[Download the tool here](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk-scm-contributors-count).

***

## Maven accuracy improvements

October 25, 2021

**Improved**

We are about to roll out a new version of our Maven dependency resolution mechanism üéâ

You can expect to see more accurate packages and versions in Maven projects imported from Git, for example when using frameworks such as Spring Boot and Jackson that use `dependencyManagement`.

Note that when the upgrade is applied you may find that more vulnerabilities are reported for your projects. This is because the new dependency graph contains more accurate versions, which can be older and more vulnerable than the previous results.

This upgrade will be applied gradually to all Snyk organizations over the next few weeks.

No action is required from yourself, the updated results will appear when your project's daily recurring tests are run.

***

## Multiple branch / version support in the CLI

October 21, 2021

**New**, **open beta**

Sometimes your project might have multiple states which you want to monitor separately. These could be branches, releases, deployments and so on. We are happy to announce that you can now use `--target-reference` to separate projects into these specific groupings, being able to monitor multiple instances of your project.

To start using this feature, you‚Äôd need to update the CLI to the latest version and run the snyk monitor command with the `--target-reference` option.

For more information, please visit our [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/grouping-projects-by-branch-or-version).

***

## Snyk Container Security Data Update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Amazon Linux

October 13, 2021

**New**

We are changing the way we display vulnerabilities, from RHSA and ALAS to present issues based on the CVEs as part of an ongoing effort to improve our container security data.

Prior to these changes, we have provided information only through Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA) and Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS), both of which are collections of fixed CVEs.

The following are some of the key features of this change:

* Enhanced accuracy by showing CVEs - Instead of presenting a consolidated single advisory, which may cover more than one CVE, we will now show each CVE separately. In addition, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux we will now show both fixed and unfixed CVEs, whereas the RHSA only shows fixed CVEs. For Amazon Linux, we will still only support fixed CVEs at this time.
* Showing individual CVEs allows us to provide enriched vulnerability metadata on these CVEs, like [Exploit Maturity](https://docs.snyk.io/features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/evaluating-and-prioritizing-vulnerabilities), [Social Trends](https://docs.snyk.io/features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/prioritizing-issues/prioritize-by-social-trends) and more.
* In addition, we will also provide the severity of the issues as evaluated by the Red Hat Security Team (Low, Moderate, Important, Critical), as part of the [Relative Importance](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/snyk-container-security-basics/understanding-linux-vulnerability-severity) feature.

Important notes:

* Once the rollout is over, the old data will not be available.
* The number of issues might increase significantly as a result of the change. If you use the Reports function you may see a spike in issues.

## Snyk Apps

October 6, 2021

**New, Open beta**

**We‚Äôre excited to announce the open beta of Snyk Apps - new extensibility points that enable you to expand the Snyk platform to easily integrate into your specific workflows!**

Snyk Apps turn integrations into first-class citizens of the Snyk platform and as such, have the following characteristics:

* Snyk Apps are easy to build and use with a great UX for both authors and end users provisioning them.
* Snyk Apps are based on the Snyk API. This means that integrations are inherently more stable and safer to use than before. A Snyk app will not, for example, break when a user accidentally deletes their personal API key!
* Snyk Apps are more secure. Implementing OAuth 2.0, they have granular permissions that you define so they only get access to what they need.

We‚Äôd love to invite our users to build their own app!

_More details on Snyk Apps and how to get started can be found in our_ [_documentation_](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-apps)_._

üë©‚Äçüîß Happy building!

## Jenkins plugin V3

August 11, 2021

**Improved**

Happy to announce that we‚Äôve released a new major version of the Jenkins plugin üéâ

The new version supports new functionally and introduces significant improvements to the developer experience.

Here is a list of the main improvements:

#### Improved performance

Snyk installations are now downloaded from our CDN, e.g. static.snyk.io instead of github.com which decreases the installation time and improves the overall plugin performance.

#### Improved error handling and status reporting

Added a new option to not fail the step on errors such as failed installs or bad configuration and improved the failure logic so a failing test runs would fail only the current step rather than the entire build.

#### Credential Binding support

SNYK\_TOKEN can now be provided as build environment variable, allowing users to use injected secrets and integrate credential vaults.

#### Multiple report support

HTML reports now use a date and time or their name, allowing users to run Snyk multiple times in a build to generate multiple reports

#### Improved documentation

Improved explanation on how the plugin works and usage instructions.

#### Other improvements and bug fixes

* Increased minimum supported Jenkins version to 2.222.4
* Increased minimum supported Snyk CLI version to 1.500.0
* NodeJS and NPM installations are no longer required to run the step, though you may still need them to test your NodeJS-specific projects
* All Monitor and stderr output are now forwarded to Console Output and \*.debug files are no longer generated

For more info on how to install and use the plugin, see the instructions in the [plugin's public repo page](https://github.com/jenkinsci/snyk-security-scanner-plugin).

## Snyk Code Priority Score

August 4, 2021

**New**

We are happy to announce that Snyk Code now supports Priority Scores, allowing you to filter and prioritize issues in your Snyk Code projects.

As Snyk Code only includes one project per repo, with potentially thousands of files in the project, you may see a very large list of issues. Assigning Priority Scores to each issue allows you to focus on fixing the most important issues.

Priority scores appear in the same way as for other Snyk products, allowing you to use all Snyk products in a similar manner to review and prioritize issues.

For more information, see [product documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360009884837-Snyk-Priority-Score).

***

## Snyk Code support for C\#

August 3, 2021

**New**

We are happy to announce that C# is now fully supported in Snyk Code, adding to existing Snyk Code support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Java.

C# is the most prominent of the .NET framework languages, and frequently used to write web or enterprise applications. Snyk Code now supports C# and common frameworks such as .NET and .NET Core as well as ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.

Existing projects will automatically use the new knowledge base when automatic rescan is performed. You can also trigger a rescan for immediate results.

We are working hard to add Snyk Code support for more languages in the coming months.

For more information:

* See this [blog article](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-code-security-scanning-c-sharp-dot-net/).

## Manage Snyk users at scale

July 26, 2021

As your organization grows from dozens to hundreds (or even thousands) of users, it can become increasingly difficult to manage them. This can be anything from:

* Finding a user or a group of users
* Understanding when they first joined Snyk
* Changing their roles
* Removing them from your organization

With that, it gives us great pleasure to announce that we redesigned the organization member management page within Snyk. You can perform all of the tasks you originally were able to, but we‚Äôve added pagination, filtering, and search to improve the performance and usability of the page at scale. In addition, we‚Äôve added sorting to the columns to allow you to organize your users as you need.

## Snyk Infrastructure as Code - Terraform Plan support in the CLI

March 26, 2021

**Open beta**

I'm pleased to announce we have released a public beta of new functionality in the Snyk IaC CLI in version `1.511.0`

You can now scan your Terraform Plan output, which will include any variables & modules that you use, enabling us to detect a broader range of security misconfigurations.

## Automatic fix pull requests for Dockerfiles

March 17, 2021

**New**

We're thrilled to share that Snyk can now raise fix pull requests against your Dockerfiles!

For every scanned Dockerfile that contains a base image for which we provide recommendations, we will raise an automatic fix PR in case there is a better base image that can be used. The PR will be opened with the minor upgrade available.

After it is opened, the fix PR can be found in your Git repository, showing the FROM line changed in your Dockerfile, updated with the new and improved base image version.

We also provide the option to manually open a fix PR and upgrade to any of the base image recommendations we provide (rather than just the minor version). This option is available using a button next to each one of the base images in the recommendations table.

You can enable/disable the feature using the setting that can be found in the integration level.

You can learn more about our automatic Dockerfile fix PR capability [in our blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/issuing-fix-prs-to-update-dockerfiles/).

For more details about opening PRs in your Dockerfile, see our [product documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/scan-your-dockerfile/open-pull-requests-to-fix-vulnerable-base-images-in-your-dockerfile).

## New issue card design

March 2, 2021

**New**

We‚Äôve redesigned the issue card on the project page, to help developers understand what they need to fix something much quicker. This involves streamlining the header of the card to only contain key information required to fix issues. The other contextual information is still available in the card, but tucked away slightly so you can really focus on the critical information.

We‚Äôve also added an extra filter, and the ability to sort issues

To see how we‚Äôve made the issue card more concise and valuable, open any Snyk projects you have. For more information on the specific features within the issue card, see the [product user documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360018049037).

## Bug fix: Dependencies using dual/multiple licenses alignment

February 22, 2021

**Fix**

We have released a bug fix to align the way license severities are resolved and displayed for dependencies using dual/multiple licenses.

Previously, for these dependencies, the resolved license severity was not always displayed within the Snyk UI and exported CSV reports. Also, the API (Licenses, Licenses by organization, and List all licenses) response did not show when a certain dependency uses more than one license.

This fix aligns Snyk‚Äôs license reporting, to show accurate license details across the UI, exported CSVs, and the API.

## Ending Snyk CLI support for Node.js 8.x

January 25, 2021

Starting from 15.02.2021, the Snyk CLI will no longer support Node.js 8.x.

LTS support for this version expired at the end of 2019 and no longer receives security updates. We consider it a general security best practice to always use runtime environments that are more up-to-date.

**What does this mean?** Starting from the stated date above, using the latest version of the Snyk CLI (v. 1.437.4 and above) with Node.js 8.x, either locally or as part of an automated build pipeline, might fail.

**What should you do?** For optimized Snyk CLI operations, we recommend upgrading Node.js to the current stable version - version 14.x.

The Snyk team is here to help! Feel free to reach out to support in case you encounter any issues or have any questions.

See the [product documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003812458-Getting-started-with-the-CLI) for more details.
