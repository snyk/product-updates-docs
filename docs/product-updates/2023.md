## Configurable Python version in Snyk Open Source SCM scans in Open Beta

December 19, 2023

Open beta

We are very pleased to announce that you can now define the Python version used when scanning `pip` projects imported via Git integrations in Snyk Open Source!

Until now, Snyk would always use either Python 2.7 or 3.7 which could lead to some dependencies being omitted from results if they require newer versions.

You can now specify the minor version of Python to use in scans.

To try this out go to your Organization Settings. First enable the beta listed in **Snyk Preview**. Next, go to **Languages** > **Python** and specify the Python version to use.

For more details see the documentation [available here](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/supported-languages-and-frameworks/python#pip-and-python-versions).

## Using Project Tags at scale with removed group limits and predictable permissions

December 11, 2023

**Improved**

[Project Tags](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-tags) are a lightweight and easy way to organise your Projects into bespoke criteria. They also have great synergy with [Project Collections](https://updates.snyk.io/project-collections-ga-268069) to help you visualise your grouping criteria (such as teams or services), focus work, and generate reports.

However, there has traditionally been a couple of points of friction when it comes to using tags at scale:

* You could only create 1000 tags per group, which meant that you might hit your limit quickly (even with good tag management).
* Different permissions were required to create a tag within a group, and assign a tag to a Project, so even if you had an org role that would allow you to work with tags on a project, you might not have the group permission that allowed you to create the tag.

Ultimately, users want the ability to group their Projects by any criteria without any limits, and to not work inefficiently because they're blocked by permission issues. So we're pleased to announce that we have removed the group tag limit, and we're making tag permissions more predictable in behaviour.

The org permission to assign and remove a tag to a project is now sufficient for all tags and will be applied to `group admin`, `org admin`, and `collaborator` roles whilst the permissions for custom roles will remain as they were before this work was delivered. The two differences to your experience will be:

* When you create a custom role, you do not require separate group permission to work with tags, which also helps improve security as you don't need to provide users with group permissions to enable org level functionality.
* The concept of creating and deleting a tag no longer exists. If a tag isn't assigned to a Project, it will not exist.

All of the Project Tag APIs will continue to work as they currently do today.

## Slack App: Channel ID entry for configuration

December 8, 2023

**Improved**

We're excited to share an update for the Slack app, introducing a new method for configuring channels to receive notifications. This addresses slow loading times for channel lists by enabling users to input Channel IDs directly. This enhancement ensures a quick verification process and immediate access to channel information, such as the name, right after entering the ID. Experience improved efficiency and responsiveness with this update.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack_channel_id_setting.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Reminder: v1 List All Projects API end-of-life and upcoming brownout

December 4, 2023

**Deprecated**

We announced on [June 22nd](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/deprecation-and-end-of-life-for-the-list-all-projects-v1-api-267781) that we will end-of-life the [v1 List All Projects API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects) on December 22nd. Alongside the announcement, we have shared a [migration guide](https://go.snyk.io/rs/677-THP-415/images/Snyk%20v1%20API%20Migration%20Guide.pdf) and have released enhancements to our [GA REST APIs](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-11-27#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/projects) to help facilitate the migration. These APIs will provide more consistent versioning, pagination and caching, and improved performance for you.

In addition, we have had two brownouts in [October](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/scheduled-brownouts-for-the-list-all-projects-v1-api-endpoint-276313) and [November](https://updates.snyk.io/reminder-v1-list-all-projects-api-end-of-life-and-upcoming-brownouts-278768), and there is one more to go on December 6th for 4 hours starting 17:00 UTC.

## Announcing Import API Location header change and support for all Snyk environments

December 1, 2023

**Improved**

We recently released a minor change to the [Import Targets API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/import-projects/import/import-targets). This asynchronous API spawns a separate import job, and returns a `201 Created` response and a `Location` header which should be followed to fetch additional progress details about the import job.

Previously, the Location header was only valid on Snyk’s US-based region. But following this change, the `Location` header is now a valid URL across all [available regions](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/data-residency-at-snyk#what-regions-are-available).

If you are performing validation on the `Location` header, e.g. to verify it is a domain owned by Snyk before following the URL, please update your validation for your appropriate region URL. Snyk’s region-specific URLs are available [here](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/data-residency-at-snyk#what-regions-are-available).

For any additional questions, [please contact support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us).

## "Project Type" filter

November 27, 2023

**New**

As your organisation grows, the number and variety of Project types in your system also scales, so the ability to find the Projects you work with can become more difficult. Features such as [Project Collections](https://updates.snyk.io/project-collections-ga-268069) improve the ability to organise and work with Projects at scale, so it's important to improve how they can be created.

We're pleased to announce that we've added a "Project Type" filter to the Project Listing page which will improve a user's ability to find the Projects they need to work with. By filtering your Projects by type, you can perform actions such as tagging and creating Project Collections more easily.

## GitHub Cloud App available in Open Beta

November 20, 2023

**Open beta**

Today, Snyk is announcing the Open Beta availability of the GitHub Cloud app. The GitHub Cloud App represents a significant advancement over our current GitHub integrations, offering enhanced features such as role-based, granular access control, increased API rate limits, and serving as a foundation for expanded and enriched developer experiences.

After we make this generally available next year, our intention is that this app will replace the existing OAuth (aka "GitHub Enterprise") and PAT (aka "GitHub") based GitHub integrations on our platform.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/github_cloud_app_integration.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Open Beta kicks off with customers in the US-based instance (app.snyk.io) using GitHub Cloud, and supports a single GitHub Org for a Snyk Org. Over the next month, we are committed to further refining the Cloud app, introducing the following improvements:

* In the upcoming month, we plan to extend support to EU and AU environments and enable a single GitHub Org to connect with multiple Snyk Orgs.
* By the end of the year, we will extend this functionality to customers using GitHub Server (on-prem).

We encourage you to connect with your account teams to opt-in, refer to our [User Docs](https://docs.snyk.io/integrate-with-snyk/git-repository-scm-integrations/snyk-github-cloud-app) for more detailed information. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

## Snyk Code: PR Checks Reliability Update New Improved

November 18, 2023

**New**, **Improved**

At Snyk Code we have been focused on improving the reliability of Snyk Code PR Checks. We released at the end of October an update to one of our most error-prone services, and we have seen major improvements in the reliability, with the service going from being part of 50% of all errors, to close to none. Today, we have rolled out this improvement to all environments.

For customers using Snyk Code PR Checks through the Snyk Broker:

* Please update the Broker to version 4.168.4 or higher (recommended to go to the latest version).
* If you are using a custom accept.json, update to the latest rules.
* If you are using Bitbucket, please make sure you are using Bitbucket 7.0 or above.

We continue to improve the overall reliability and scalability of Snyk Code, and we will have more updates in the coming months. If you have any questions, please reach out to your account teams. Thank you.

## Snyk Code: PHP Interfile Re-release

November 15, 2023

**Fix**

Over the past few weeks, we’ve been working to find the root cause and to update internal testing to ensure we identify these type of issues prior to production. As of today, we have turned on the first batch of rules for PHP interfile.

We are rolling out changes in how the analysis handles data flow which will result in significantly shorter and more accurate data flow in complex cases. From our testing, we expect this will change between 0.5-1% of issues across all languages.

After this step, pending positive internal testing, all the PHP interfile rules will be re-enabled over the next two weeks.

If you have any questions, please reach out to your account teams.

## Removing friction when changing test frequency for Projects in the UI

November 15, 2023

**Improved**

Earlier this year, we [migrated the ability](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/project-collections-ga-268069) to perform bulk actions in the Project Listing Page from the Usage page. Another bulk action which was available on the usage page was the "Change Test Frequency" functionality.

To remove friction where you'd have to jump between pages to perform bulk actions on Projects, we've migrated the Change Test Frequency functionality to the Project Listing Page.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/change_test_frequency.png" alt="" width="310"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For more information on the functionality, check out the [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/introduction-to-snyk-projects).

## Making Project Collections more discoverable and Target centric

November 14, 2023

**Improved**

In June, we [announced](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/project-collections-ga-268069) the general availability of Project Collections. Since then, we've been gathering feedback on the feature's usability as we aim to go deeper on the experience with [automatically created Project Collections](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/deduplicating-targets-through-automatically-created-project-collections-276359).

Based on the feedback, we needed to improve the discoverability of the feature and the experience for users who work on the Target-level. Therefore, we've just released a couple of improvements to the existing functionality:

1. Collections are now present in the Projects area as a standalone tab so that anyone can dive into them quickly and easily.
2. You can see at a glance which Target a Project belongs to within a Collection as we have added a sortable Target column. In addition, we've enabled the ability to filter by Target within a Collection.

We'll be adding more usability improvements to the feature over time, so your feedback is valued. For more information, head to the [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-collections-groupings/project-collections).

## CVE and NVD CVSS Score Enhancements - Upcoming Data Changes

November 6, 2023

**New**

On **November 14th**, Snyk will roll out a change that will broaden Snyk Open Source vulnerabilities granularity to support CVSS vectors assigned by NVD, to support additional compliance workflows.

#### **Background on Snyk IDs and CVE IDs**:

For each new vulnerability, Snyk assigns a unique Snyk Identifier (SNYK-ID) and CVSS vector (which translates to score and severity)

This allows Snyk:

* To publish new vulnerabilities faster, even before they have an officially assigned CVE ID.
* To represent the issue in a single, specific package, therefore providing highly accurate information. A CVE ID, on the other hand, represents the vulnerability as a whole security issue and can be associated with multiple affected packages.

A CVE ID, on the other hand, represents the vulnerability as a whole security issue and can be associated with multiple affected packages.

In rare cases, Snyk’s Security Analysts assign multiple CVE IDs to one SNYK-ID. This happens in cases where there is very high similarity or duplicates between multiple CVEs.

#### **Details about the change**:

Starting November 14th, cases with multiple CVEs and different NVD CVSS vectors will be separated into multiple advisories (multiple Snyk-IDs), one per CVE. These cases amount to less than 0.6% of Snyk’s vulnerabilities.

This will provide customers with increased vulnerability granularity and ensure compatibility with NVD-provided CVSS vectors.

Snyk’s hand-curated CVSS is recommended for accurate and timely analysis, while NVD CVSS is useful for compliance-based needs, like FedRAMP reports.

To create a report of the vulnerabilities with the NVD CVSS Score: Click on Reports → Modify Columns → and select NVD Severity and NVD Score.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/modify_columns_nvd_severity_and_score.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **Important notes**:

* **The number of issues you see might increase**. This is due to the change in issue representation to consider NVD CVSS vectors as an independent issue factor.
* After this change, in the rare cases in which multiple CVE IDs are associated with one SNYK-ID, the NVD CVSS vector provided will be relevant for both CVE IDs. A retest, a manual test, or a scheduled scan for monitored Projects, is needed to see the changes.
* Although the overall number of issues (Snyk Open Source) might increase due to the broadening of the granularity to include NVD and CVSS vectors, **these issues can be solved with the same fix**.
* If a new advisory was created from an ignored issue, it will still appear in the Project. If not relevant, the new issue will need to be ignored as well. This is because the new advisory has a different NVD CVSS score, and Snyk cannot assume it is irrelevant to your Project.
* The Snyk CVSS will remain similar between the advisories.
* The related CVE, which the advisory was separated from, will be included in the advisory details.

## Snyk Open Source Improvements: Fixability filters

November 6, 2023

**Improved**

Snyk has now made it easier to determine what issues have a fix available and what issues Snyk can potentially help you fix!

When you're analyzing the issues in your project, in addition to our existing fixability filter, we've now introduced a new feature that allows you to identify security issues with a known fix in general, irrespective of whether we can directly assist you.

This enhancement provides you with a comprehensive view of potential vulnerabilities and solutions, enabling you to make more informed decisions about your security posture while we are continously working in supporting more and more ecosystems and fixes.

Try our new "Fixed In" Available filter in the Projects Dashboard and be on top of your issues! You can read more about it [here](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/snyk-open-source/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-fix-types).

## Customize your PRs via API

October 30, 2023

**New**, **Closed beta**

We are very excited to announce our recent Closed Beta feature: the ability to [customize settings for how your PRs look using an API.](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-applications/snyk-open-source/open-source-basics/customize-pr-templates-closed-beta)

Today, Snyk raises PRs using a default standard format for title, description, and commit message or branch name.

However, we know that you may have your own standards and practices for the content of your PRs. We're building this feature to make it easier for you to customize the content of your PRs for your entire Group. With this API, you can set a template for your expected PR format, which Snyk will use for all PRs.

Read more about the feature [here](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-applications/snyk-open-source/open-source-basics/customize-pr-templates-closed-beta). Please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in participating in the Closed Beta and trying out this feature early!

## Snyk Code Rollback: Hardcoded Secrets Improvement

October 27, 2023

**Fix**

On Oct 23rd, we deployed an improvement that aligned our hardcoded secrets behavior for JavaScript and Java, causing an increase in CWE-547 (Hardcoded Secrets). Unfortunately the rule change made a larger impact than intended, resulting in reports of false positives. We have decided to roll back the deployment, and this will be pushed to production on Friday, Oct 27th.

Customers may have seen an increase in hardcoded secrets issues, specifically for CWE-547 in JavaScript and Java. Starting Monday, Oct 30th, the issues and any resulting false positives generated last week will be corrected.

If you have any questions, please reach out to your account teams.

## Support for SPDX in SBOM Test APIs Beta

October 25, 2023

**New**, **Open beta**

We’re pleased to share that Snyk's [SBOM Test APIs](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-10-13\~beta#post-/orgs/-org\_id-/sbom\_tests) now support SPDX.

[Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/about/overview/) is part of The Linux Foundation® and described as "an open standard for communicating software bill of material information, including provenance, license, security, and other related information".

As a developer, you can now [test SPDX 2.3 JSON documents for vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/rest-api-endpoints-test-an-sbom-document-for-vulnerabilities). There is no need to specify this in your request, Snyk will automatically detect the SBOM format and test accordingly. This release adds to our existing support for CycloneDX — ensuring you can use both of the leading SBOM specifications.

As always, we’re excited to hear your feedback. Please reach out if you have any questions.

## Snyk Code: Python 2 Deprecation of Support

October 19, 2023

**Deprecated**

Starting October 26th, Snyk Code will begin the 3 month process of deprecating Python 2 language support. Further, we plan to End of Life (EOL) on January 23, 2024, where Python 2 support will be terminated. For context, Python 2 has been unsupported by Python.org since January 2020.

This means that no new development work and no new support tickets related to Python 2 will be processed. Existing Python 2 projects will continue to be scanned until EOL. After EOL, Python 2 findings will no longer appear in your results.

Note that support for Python 3 will not be affected and continue as usual.

If you are using Python 2, please reach out to your account teams.

## CCSS: New Severity Framework for IaC+

October 17, 2023

**New**

We are pleased to announce Snyk’s move to CCSS, a severity framework, for IaC+.

Prior to October 16, 2023, Snyk security researchers used an internal severity framework to determine the severity of the rules for IaC+ (new version of Snyk IaC).

To provide greater accuracy, additional ways to prioritize issues, and transparency in determining the IaC+ rules severity, Snyk is moving to use the Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS).

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed CCSS. Also, it is derived from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which was developed to measure the severity of vulnerabilities and is used today in Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container products.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/priorities-for-fixing-issues/severity-levels#severity-levels-and-ccss) and explore all the new scores and severities at [https://security.snyk.io/rules/cloud/](https://security.snyk.io/rules/cloud/).

## Native support for Apple silicon in Snyk CLI

October 13, 2023

**New**

We are pleased to announce that – going forward as of [version 1.1230.0](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1230.0) – Snyk CLI natively supports [Apple silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple\_silicon). You are no longer required to manually install [Apple’s Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211861) before installing Snyk CLI.

For our Apple silicon users this means whether you are installing directly – via any of our [supported installation methods](https://github.com/snyk/cli#install-snyk-cli) – or via an IDE plugin, the correct and latest Apple silicon build will be selected and installed on the system automatically.

With this improvement, our Apple silicon users will be able to

* experience a simplified Snyk CLI installation,
* and secure code without compromising on productivity, performance, or their compliance needs.

To get started with Snyk CLI, or for more information, [please read the docs](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli).

## The New REST Issues API is now in Beta!

October 13, 2023

**New**, **Open beta**

We are excited to announce the Beta release of the new Issues API REST endpoints, which unifies all Snyk issues (SCA, SAST, Cloud) across projects or orgs into one API call. The Unified Issues API approach offers several key benefits:

* Simplifies the user experience with one paginated API call across all projects or orgs
* Saves time by eliminating the need to stitch data across various calls and offering a consistent schema to parse responses with
* Highlights our commitment to building Snyk as a holistic security platform

The Beta version builds on the Experimental versions with the following new features:

* Stable UUIDs which will not change with releases of future versions thus minimizing breaking changes going forward
* New Risk Score and Factors allowing for assessing risk using broader issue, application and business context
* Increased performance profile with faster response times

Please check out the API docs for [listing all issues by group](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-09-29%7Ebeta#get-/groups/-group\_id-/issues), and [by org](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-09-29%7Ebeta#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/issues).

## Snyk Code Rollback: PHP Interfile

October 10, 2023

**Fix**

Following the [incident last Friday, October 6th](https://status.snyk.io/incidents/lvn0gz5rqpbp), we’re temporarily rolling back PHP Interfile starting today as part of our mitigation strategy. For customers with PHP code, you may see a decreased number of results.

We recognize the importance of PHP Interfile and are actively working towards a solution.

We don’t have a confirmed timeline yet, but will provide updates once the situation stabilizes.

Please reach out with any questions.

## Deduplicating Targets through automatically created Project Collections

October 10, 2023

**New**, **Closed beta**

Following the release of [Project Collections in June](https://updates.snyk.io/project-collections-ga-268069), we’re building on the story further to help improve managing your projects at scale, whilst removing some friction our users see.

Users will often scan the same project through multiple methods depending on the purpose. Scanning projects from the SCM enables you to leverage features such as PR checks, while scanning projects through a CI/CD pipeline (via the CLI) will create a gating mechanism so that certain vulnerabilities do not reach critical environments. However, a Target is created for a single project for each different scan method used (the CLI and SCM), which also results in duplicate projects, and duplicate issues which can lead to inefficiencies in working within the projects area and inaccurate counts in reporting.

We’re proud to announce that we’re releasing closed beta functionality which will improve efficiency when working with projects and accuracy of reporting if you scan the same project from multiple methods. When the same project is scanned from the SCM and the CLI, Snyk will automatically group those projects together within a newly created Project Collection. From this new Project Collection, you can choose which scan method’s results you want to filter out so that you work with your projects more efficiently, and you can generate more accurate reports on the filtered Collections. The Project Collection’s new issue count will be reflected in the Collection listing page, and in the reporting area too.

Snyk will not merge or delete any projects or issues because knowing where in your SDLC a vulnerability was introduced has value.

## Open beta availability of Git repository cloning

September 27, 2023

**Open beta**

**Today, Snyk is pleased to announce open beta availability of** [**Git repository cloning**](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/how-snyk-handles-your-data#git-repository-cloning) **– a new, and more scalable way for Snyk to provide code security and code quality improvements via** [**SCM integrations**](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations) **– helping you develop fast and stay secure.**

The open beta is rolling out to all customers, and across all of Snyk’s deployments in the coming days, and will be available – via [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/manage-settings/snyk-preview) – for all SCM integrations (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Cloud App, Bitbucket Cloud (Legacy), and Azure Repos), and SCM “flows” ([import](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/quickstart/import-a-project), [PR checks](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/run-pr-checks), [recurring tests](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/running-tests#run-tests-automatically-with-the-snyk-web-ui)).

When enabled by a [Snyk Organization administrator](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/introduction-to-snyk-administration), these flows will be backed by a temporary and shallow Git clone of repository contents, helping Snyk perform its security analyses [more reliably](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/how-snyk-handles-your-data#how-git-cloning-supports-more-reliable-results) and [more accurately](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/how-snyk-handles-your-data#how-git-cloning-supports-more-accurate-results). This capability has particular benefit for customers using SCM integrations at scale, as it protects against a breach of SCM API rate- and content- limits, and improves Snyk’s analysis of very large repos (sometimes referred to as “monorepos”), by surfacing previously unreachable contents.

Be on the lookout for this new capability, scheduled to land in your Snyk Organization in the coming days.

Meanwhile, you can read more [in the docs](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/how-snyk-handles-your-data#git-repository-cloning).

## Snyk Code Announcement: PHP Improvements

September 13, 2023

**Improved**

Snyk Code has been at the forefront of PHP static analysis since its launch 2 years ago.

In 2 weeks time we will roll out a new PHP analysis engine that is smarter. From our benchmarks, we expect a similar number of matches overall, but of much higher quality. This is due to three improvements:

* The new engine is capable of deeper analysis, and so doesn’t use approximations as often. This removes many false positive matches.
* Object-orientated code that makes use of classes, methods and properties is analysed much better, adding new correct matches.
* Interfile analysis is enabled, which detects vulnerabilities across multiple source files.

## Ensuring Compatibility: Important Update for Our JetBrains Users

August 31, 2023

**New**

Since September 2020, Snyk has provided [plugins](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/ide-tools/jetbrains-plugins) for the JetBrains family of IDEs – IntelliJ, WebStorm, Android Studio and [more](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/ide-tools/jetbrains-plugins) – so developers using these tools have Snyk’s world-class developer-first security tooling at their fingertips.

#### **A Commitment to Compatibility**

As developers ourselves, we understand the significance of having a seamless and efficient coding experience, and we are committed to ensuring that our JetBrains plugins align with the latest advancements in the JetBrains ecosystem. To achieve this, we have decided to align our plugins' supported versions with [those officially supported by JetBrains](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019574859-What-versions-of-IntelliJ-based-IDEs-are-supported-). This alignment is crucial to maintaining stability, functionality, and performance in your coding environment.

#### **Supported IntelliJ Versions**

Moving forward, our plugins will exclusively support versions of JetBrains IDEs that are also supported by JetBrains. This means that our plugins' features, updates, and optimizations will be guaranteed to work flawlessly on these officially endorsed versions. We believe that by synchronizing our efforts with JetBrains' own support roadmap, we can provide you with an unparalleled coding experience.

While we strive to ensure compatibility with officially supported JetBrains versions, we understand that some of our users might continue to utilize older, unsupported versions. While our plugin might continue to function on such versions, we cannot guarantee the same level of reliability and performance as on the officially supported releases. [Older versions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10972-snyk-security--code-open-source-container-iac-configurations/versions) of our plugin are available for download on [the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10972-snyk-security--code-open-source-container-iac-configurations/versions).

For the best experience with our plugins, we strongly recommend that you always use the latest version of the IDE supported by JetBrains. This approach not only ensures optimal performance but also allows you to benefit from the latest features and security enhancements provided by both JetBrains and our plugin.

#### **Support When You Need It**

If you encounter any difficulties while using our JetBrains plugins, we encourage you to first ensure that you are using a supported version of the IDE. If problems persist, please don't hesitate to reach out to [our dedicated support team](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us). We are here to assist you and resolve any concerns you may have.

Thank you for being a part of our journey towards secure coding greatness!

## Changes to Dependencies tab and API

August 29, 2023

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and reliability of Snyk, we’ve made some changes to the database infrastructure behind the [Dependencies tab](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-issues/dependencies-and-licenses/view-dependencies) UI and [v1 List all dependencies API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/dependencies/dependencies-by-organization/list-all-dependencies).

All requests will now be served by a read replica, rather than the primary database. Moving read-intensive APIs like this one dedicated database infrastructure helps ensure that our systems remain stable.

When importing a Project, it's expected that changes will be reflected in the Dependencies tab and API after 10 seconds. You should not notice this change on your end, and we expect the impact on your usage of Snyk to be negligible.

## Change to Group Admin Role

August 23, 2023

**Improved**

We've made a change to how we model Group Admin's roles in terms of the Orgs within their group. Previously they would always be explicitly assigned the Org Admin role for every single Org in their Group. Now this is no longer explicit, but implied by the fact that they have the Group Admin role. There is no change in their capabilities because of this, and no action is required. The only noticeable difference will be that they no longer appear on the list of Org members. We have also made the equivalent change for Service Accounts which were assigned the Group Admin Role.

Please contact support or your account representative if you have any questions or concerns.

## New Risk Score for open source and container issues

August 17, 2023

**Open beta**

We're excited to announce the open beta availability of Snyk’s new Risk Score!

The [new Risk Score](https://snyk.io/blog/introducing-new-risk-score) was designed to help you prioritize more effectively by providing you with an accurate and holistic understanding of the risk posed by a given security issue.

The Risk Score is powered by a new risk assessment model that leverages multiple objective and contextual risk factors to measure both the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited as well as the impact it may have if exploited.

Examples of risk factors included in the new Risk Score: Reachability, Exploit Maturity, EPSS, Social Trends, CVSS metrics, transitive depth, business criticality, and more.

Please refer to our documentation for the full list of risk factors as well as information on how the score is calculated.

The new Risk Score is available, in open beta, for all Snyk users and only displayed for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container projects. To enable the score, turn it on via Snyk Preview.

## Snyk tools which use the List all projects v1 API now use REST APIs

August 15, 2023

**Improved**

Following the [June announcement](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/deprecation-and-end-of-life-for-the-list-all-projects-v1-api-267781) of the end-of-life of the [List all projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects), we’re happy to announce that we’ve migrated the Snyk tools and integrations which use the List all projects v1 API to use the [GA REST APIs](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-05-29#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/projects).

The main benefit of the new version of the tools which uses the REST APIs is that the performance will improve greatly, and you’ll see that benefit when you upgrade your tools so we strongly encourage you to do so.

For a list of the tools that were using the older API and will now be using the REST APIs, check out our [migration guide](https://go.snyk.io/rs/677-THP-415/images/Snyk%20v1%20API%20Migration%20Guide.pdf).

## Disabling certain filters being enabled by default on the Project listing page

August 2, 2023

**Improved**

We are pleased to announce that Snyk is no longer making filters on the project listing page enabled by default. We originally added this default functionality to improve the performance on the project listing page but since the improvements we’ve made and with pagination in place, we no longer need to have default functionality that might confuse users. The filters in question are the "Without Issues" and the "Deactivated Projects" filters.

We are not removing the filter from the page and it will remain usable, but we are no longer enabling it by default when you create a new organization. As before, filters are part of the URL and so can be bookmarked or shared.

## Issue Summary removed from the Dashboard

July 13, 2023

The Snyk Dashboard is a valuable asset for users to identify their open issues and vulnerable projects. However, beginning today, issue summary data has been removed from the Snyk Dashboard because of the potential for inconsistencies with data in other locations of the product. The Projects and Reporting features continue to provide access to issue summary data, so you can look there instead of on the dashboard.

We’re excited about future additions to the dashboard to make it even more relevant and integrated with your security needs. Please contact support or your account manager if you have any questions or concerns.

## Snyk Open Source Bug Fix on Cocoapod License detection

June 28, 2023

**Fix**

On June 27th 2023, we resolved a bug in our Cocoapods license detection capability. This fix ensures that previously missing license information for Cocoapod subspecs is now accurately displayed.

Consequently, during your scans, you may start noticing newly surfaced license issues related to Cocoapod subspecs if they violate the [license policy](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-issues/policies/license-policies/create-a-license-policy-and-rules) you have set at Snyk.

If you have any questions regarding this update or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to our support team.

## Snyk Open Source License Improvements

June 28, 2023

**Improved**

We are thrilled to announce that Snyk Open Source license detection database now includes [SPDX v3.20](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/releases/tag/v3.20) license types. This will result in Snyk Open Source resolving over 150 additional license types.

#### Value:

1. Visibility into license types and issues against the [SPDX v3.20](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/releases/tag/v3.20) license list.
2. Reduction in missing license information with Snyk.

#### What are the changes?

1. The number of license detections should remain the same, but the level of detail will improve. Previously, Snyk reported these licenses as an _Unknown_ type, but after this change, the license types in the [SPDX v3.20](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/releases/tag/v3.20) list will be reported.
2. The severity for the new license types added will inherit the _Unknown_ license type severity, which is Snyk’s standard practice, per the [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/licenses).
3. If you take no action you will have the same number of license detections with the same severity as you do today. The only change will be the level of detail, as Snyk will report the license name instead of _Unknown_.

#### Suggested actions to take:

1. Because this change adds the new license information, you can change the severity for these 150+ license types, providing more granular control over handling open source licenses.
2. We suggest you review the new license types that will be included with your legal and compliance teams. You can use the [license policy feature ](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-issues/policies/license-policies)in Snyk to customize the severity for individual license types. The default License Policy built-in to Snyk shows an example of this.
3. Our research team has reviewed the new license types that are coming with this implementation and has provided our perspective on them([Link to Snyk suggested severity](https://go.snyk.io/rs/677-THP-415/images/SPDX\_Licenses\_SuggestedSeverity\_May31.pdf)). This is not legal advice; rather these are suggestions based on our own review, and we encourage you to review with your own legal and compliance experts. The suggested severities shown in this document are NOT automatically added - you will need to use the [license policy feature](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-issues/policies/license-policies) to select your own severity levels. A [_How to_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y03gX\_SWqzg) video is here for your reference as well.

**Note**: This update applies to npm, RubyGems, Maven, Pip, Nuget, Composer and Cocoapods package managers. Go is not supported will this release.

***

## Snyk Open Source npm improvements

June 27, 2023

**Improved**

Snyk Open source now fully supports npm `lockfile v3` projects 🥳

## Deprecation and end-of-life for the List all projects v1 API

June 22, 2023

**New**, **Deprecated**

Snyk is rolling out an initiative to migrate users from its [List all Projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects) to the new GA REST List all projects for an org API to help continuously improve the API experience for everyone.

Based on OpenAPI specifications, Snyk’s REST API was designed to provide a more consistent, friendly, and easy-to-use API framework that introduces major improvements. The benefits of the new APIs include:

* Consistent versioning
* Pagination and caching
* Improved performance
* Specifications for client generation

As part of this initiative, we are announcing the end-of-life of [List all Projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects) will take place on December 22nd, 2023. We are taking these necessary steps to focus on evolving Snyk’s [REST List all projects API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-05-29#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/projects). No other V1 endpoints are affected as part of this deprecation.

We have created a [migration guide](https://go.snyk.io/rs/677-THP-415/images/Snyk%20v1%20API%20Migration%20Guide.pdf) enabling you to migrate from the [List all Projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects) to the REST APIs. The solutions we have provided in the migration guide should enable all of your existing use cases and minimize disruption.

From June 22nd, 2023, we will be announcing the end-of-life of the [List all Projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects). Any new customers will not be able to use the API.

We have already started migrating the Snyk tools and integrations to the new REST APIs, and aim to complete this by August 15th 2023. All you need to do is upgrade the tool when prompted, as is standard practice. [The List all Projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects) documentation in Apiary will be removed on 22nd September 2023, but the API will still be functional.

Any existing organizations and groups will have access to the API until December 22nd, 2023. On this date, we will end-of-life the [List all Projects v1 API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/all-projects/list-all-projects).

To avoid disruption, we encourage all our customers and users who rely on this API to migrate to the existing [REST List all projects API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-05-29#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/projects) before December 22nd, 2023. Failure to do so will result in broken integrations or workflow.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact support or your account manager.

## Upcoming removal of 2 Snyk Code rules

June 8, 2023

**New**, **Improved**

As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure we are providing valuable and actionable results for our users, we have determined that two current rules within the Snyk Code (SAST) scans are providing low value to our users and are planning to remove them from our ruleset in the near future.

The two rules are: `trojansourcebidicontrol` and `TrojanSourceConfusingUnicode` - both of these rules were implemented at a time in which IDEs or text editors did not report on bidirectional and UTF-8 characters, mainly in cases where right-to-left languages (i.e. Arabic/Hebrew) were inserted into left-to-right languages (i.e. English) code which could have been misrepresented as source code.

Today, most well known IDEs and text editors highlight this problem and provide visibility into it, hence - the decision to remove these rules to ensure we continue providing the highest value findings to our users to help them develop fast and secure.

## Snyk Code Release Notes: 06.2023

June 6, 2023

**Improved**

Vulnerabilities and their severities were improved and aligned across languages according to the attack vector to launch the vulnerability. Three classes of attack sources were considered from most severe to least severe:

1. Remote Exploit: This class encompasses vulnerabilities that can be exploited by directly sending a request to a server.
2. Indirect or Second-Order Exploits: These vulnerabilities involve planting malicious values in remote resources such as databases, often leading to indirect or second-order vulnerabilities.
3. Fully Client-Side Exploits: This class covers vulnerabilities that rely on environment variables, command line arguments, or other client-side elements.

As a result of our efforts, we have implemented the following changes:

* Severity reductions: We have reduced the severity ratings for code and command injection vulnerabilities detected in JavaScript client-side frameworks.
* Python command injection: Vulnerabilities launched via command line arguments and environment variables in Python have also undergone severity reductions.
* Unified severity for second-order vulnerabilities: We have standardized the severity ratings for second-order vulnerabilities, including Path Traversal, XSS, Deserialization, SQLi, ReDoS, and XPath injection, across all supported Snyk Code languages. Direct server attack sources now carry higher severity ratings than indirect or local attack sources.

If you have noticed significant changes in the severities of vulnerabilities recently, this adjustment is likely the cause. We are constantly striving to refine our assessments and ensure they accurately reflect the potential impact of vulnerabilities on your codebase.

## Automatic gzip compression of CLI downloads via our CDN

May 30, 2023

**New**

CLI download requests from our CDN, [`static.snyk.io`](https://static.snyk.io), are now automatically compressed using the [gzip file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).

For the vast majority of our customers, this change will be entirely seamless, as this is a common HTTPS [content encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding).

Some customers – who are using an older version of our Eclipse and Visual Studio Code plugins – may see an error when the older plugin version attempts to update its internal CLI version.

Upgrading the IDE plugin to the latest version will resolve the error.

For any additional support, [please get in touch](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us).

***

## Support for additional options added to Snyk SBOM CLI extension

May 30, 2023

**Improved**

This week we released support for the `--all-projects` option in the `snyk sbom` CLI extension. This option enables you to easily generate a single CycloneDX or SPDX software bill of materials that contains packages from all manifest files detected in your project directories.

With this improvement, you can now produce an SBOM for a monorepo or other large project, even if it spans multiple languages/ecosystems. Previously, this would require generating SBOMs for each manifest file and then merging them.

We've also added support for **optional** flags that accompany the `--all-projects` option: `--name`, `--version`, `--exclude`, `--detection-depth`, `--prune-repeated-subdependencies`

To learn more, check out our [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/sbom). If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to your account team.

## Snyk Code: Uncovering Hidden Security Risks in Your Python2 Code

May 29, 2023

**New**

We will deploy a new rule to detect Python2 code starting this month. As Python2 is now unsupported by the community following its sunset in 2020, we consider this as a low-severity vulnerability that will appear in your issue reporting.

If you currently have Python2 code, you should expect to see an increase in low-severity vulnerabilities under CWE-1104. This can be conveniently filtered on the "Reports" tab in the web app. We highly recommend upgrading to Python3 to eliminate this vulnerability completely.

If you have any questions/feedback, please contact your account teams. We’d love to hear from you.

***

## Snyk Code Apex support improvement

May 24, 2023

**Improved**

We're pleased to announce that we will be adding support for `.trigger` files as part of our Apex source code scanning in Snyk Code.

The `.trigger` files are used to support managing records in Salesforce, with this addition - we offer more coverage for your Apex teams, helping ensure they are able to code more securely.

Once this improvement is implemented, if you have `.trigger` files in your Apex repositories - you should expect new findings that have not been surfaced in the past.

## Improved Go Modules scanning for Snyk Open Source

May 17, 2023

**Improved**

Today we released further improvements to Go Modules SCM support for Snyk Open Source.

We now have better support for selecting the effective versions according to the Golang [Minimal Version Selection](https://go.dev/ref/mod#minimal-version-selection) rules.

Previously, we might include multiple versions of the same package, which could lead to false positives in vulnerability reporting.

After today's change, you may see a reduction in dependencies and issues for Go Module SCM Projects, as false positives are reduced.

For the best possible accuracy in SCM scans for Go Modules applications, we recommend enabling [full source code analysis](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/snyk-open-source-supported-languages-and-package-managers/snyk-for-golang#enable-full-source-code-analysis).

## Snyk AI Fix - IDE Fix Suggestions

May 11, 2023

**New**

Snyk AI Fix is now available in open beta and can be found in the Snyk Preview section!

Snyk AI Fix is a purpose-built hybrid AI to fix complex code security issues in IDEs, while protecting your code ownership and integrity.

Our team built Snyk AI models with topical concerns in mind:

* Snyk AI models are never trained on an organization’s projects, only on open-source projects with explicit permissively open-source licensed code.
* Before Snyk AI presents a fix suggestion to a developer, our AI engine passes the updated code through our Snyk Code security engine to ensure that the fix solves the issue at hand and doesn’t introduce new problems.

The recent excitement and concern around AI in developer tools further validates the potential of the technology, but also the clear need to be thoughtful in the design and usage of AI in the enterprise, which aligns with the vision for our developer security platform.

Note this is currently available for **JavaScript**. The supported IDEs for this feature are **VS Code** and **Eclipse**.

Learn more about Snyk AI Fix, including how to turn it on in your IDEs, in our latest [Blog Post](https://snyk.co/ufIgH) and [Documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-code/fix-code-issues-automatically-with-snyk-ide-plugin-beta).

## Improved Go Modules scanning for Snyk Open Source

April 28, 2023

**Open beta**

We are pleased to announce significant improvements for scanning Go Modules projects in Snyk Open Source 🎉

Until today, when scanning [Go Modules](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/snyk-open-source-supported-languages-and-package-managers/snyk-for-golang) projects imported from Git, Snyk could only identify dependencies at the `module` level. This could lead to false positives, as it might include `packages` not used in your code.

You can now [enable full source code analysis](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/snyk-open-source-supported-languages-and-package-managers/snyk-for-golang#enable-full-source-code-analysis) for Go Modules projects imported from Git, which allows Snyk to exclude `packages` you are not using. This provides extremely high accuracy, equivalent to that of the Snyk CLI.

Once enabled, wait for the next recurring test cycle to see the improved results, or trigger a manual re-test if you can't wait 😎

## Import API v1 scalability improvements

April 14, 2023

**Improved**

We are pleased to announce some improvements to our [v1 Import API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/import-projects), designed to help customers import their repos to Snyk with ease.

This API is – and remains – asynchronous, meaning that requests are processed _outside_ of the HTTP request/response lifecycle. A `201 Created` response from the API indicates that the request has been accepted and the import will be processed asynchronously via an import job, identified by a unique `jobID`, exposed via the `Location` response header. Details of that job can then be fetched via the separate [Get import job details API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/import-projects/import-job/get-import-job-details), by passing the corresponding `jobID`.

Previously, when calling the [Import Targets API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/import-projects/import/import-targets), the request would _only_ spawn a new import job where there was no import job already running within the organization. Where an already running import job was found, the request would be _appended_ to the already running job. Essentially, multiple import requests could yield the same import `jobID`.

This behavior had a number of unwanted side effects:

1. It was hard to see the import logs for the specific import request, as multiple requests would be bundled together under the same `jobID`
2. Hence, it was hard to see when a specific import request had completed, or errored
3. Additionally, a timeout of a single import job impacted multiple import requests

To resolve these unwanted side effects, each import request will now yield a dedicated import job and a unique `jobID`. As before, the logs for the `jobID` will be visible at a unique API endpoint, via [the Get import job details API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/import-projects/import-job/get-import-job-details).

These changes will be rolling out gradually over the coming days, and are backwards compatible, meaning existing clients of the v1 Import API, including [the Snyk API import tool](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk-api-import), will continue to work without interruption.

## Improved Snyk Code engine

April 12, 2023

**New**, **Improved**

Starting next week and through the end of April, we will be deploying an updated version of the Snyk Code engine. This update is meant to improve our scalability/performance, enable deeper interfile analysis and improve debuggability from our side. Some details on what to expect and the updates that we’re making:

Deeper interfile scanning: Snyk Code is able to trace dataflow in between files and therefore find issues that other popular tools don’t. We are able to increase the depth of these interfile analysis beyond two files and surface complex vulnerabilities that span across multiple files. Note: that you may see new issues found in your scans - especially in languages like C# or Java that makes use of deep connected chains of files.

Performance and Scalability: We’ve improved the overall performance/reliability of the system especially in the case of mono-repos.

If you have any questions/feedback, Please reach out to your account teams. We’d love to hear from you.

## New reporting update

April 10, 2023

**Improved**, **Open beta**

In a few weeks, Snyk will update the grouping of issues in our new reports to better align with the way issues are grouped in the Snyk projects pages and the API. This will allow customers to focus on the prioritization and remediation of issues with improved consistency across the platform.

Customers using Snyk Open Source and Container will see fewer issues in reporting after the change, as the paths by which an issue is introduced will no longer be counted separately. Please reach out to your account team with any questions.

## New import logs UI

March 20, 2023

**Improved**

We are pleased to announce the redesigned import logs UI is now available for all users.

This redesign introduces a page loading state, and makes it easier to navigate log messages via groupings and nested pagination controls.

You also have the flexibility to opt out and continue using the old UI experience via the banner shown on the import page.

***

## New permission for Project History

March 14, 2023

**New**

The ability to view project history was incorporated within the ability to view a Project. However, to improve an organization’s security and access to the issue and dependency information, we are making `View Project` permission more granular by adding a new permission, `View Project History`. This will allow you to have more granular control of access to Project history.

We will be rolling out the change from **March 16th**, and all standard and existing custom roles will automatically have this new permission incorporated. There will be no disruption to the user experience. You will be greeted with a message to inform you that they have insufficient permissions if you attempt to view any snapshot data without your role having the permission.

If you have a custom role and you do unexpectedly encounter this issue, the solution is to apply the new permission, `View Project History` to the role if deemed required.

For more information, please read the [member roles documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/managing-users-and-permissions/member-roles#edit-a-role).

## Users can now set Project Test Frequency via API

February 22, 2023

**New**

Every day, Snyk tests users’ projects for new vulnerabilities or for keeping up to date with changes. Each project has its set Test Frequency - the cadence in which that project is to be tested for vulnerabilities.

Setting to test frequency is easily done via the Project page in the Snyk UI today. Now a new REST/v3 endpoint under the Projects API allows users to update Test Frequency to a project using a simple string parameter - test\_frequency.

## Deprecation of Serverless and Platform as a Service integrations

February 20, 2023

**Deprecated**

Snyk [integrates](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations) with many popular developer tools, languages, clouds, and other services, providing developer-first security workflows and fixes across the entire SDLC.

Today we are announcing the end-of-life of a handful of these integrations, specifically:

* AWS Lambda
* Azure Functions
* Cloud Foundry
* Heroku
* Pivotal

We are taking these necessary steps in order to focus our efforts on our customers’ greatest needs, and will continue to provide integrations via popular Git (SCM) repositories, IDEs, CI/CD services, registries, third-party clouds, and more. Additionally, Snyk is committed to being API-first by default, in order to facilitate a growing number of third-party integrations.

These integrations have been frozen starting **March 20th, 2023**, and is no longer be possible to configure _**new**_ instances of these integrations.

_**Previously**_ configured instances will continue to operate until **August 20th, 2023**. After this date projects imported via these integrations will no longer be available, and the configurations will be removed.

To avoid disruption, we encourage all our customers and users who rely on these integrations to integrate the source code for their deployments via [an SCM integration](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations).

[Reach out to support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us) with any questions.

## New user docs structure

January 24, 2023

**Improved**

We have updated the navigation and structure of the Snyk user docs, to make it simpler, easier to understand, and to match the Snyk user experience.

For example, we moved the product docs (Snyk Code, Snyk Cloud, and so on) under task-based sections ([Scan application code](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code), [Scan containers](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-containers) and [Scan cloud deployment](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-cloud-deployment)) to give greater alignment between Snyk products and the functions of these products.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/new_user_docs_structure.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We will continue to work on these areas, to ensure that our docs match the requirements and actions of our user base.

See [Snyk user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/) for more details.

## New project listing page design and functionality!

January 23, 2023

**Improved**

We’ve started to roll out a new design and feature enhancements for the project listing page! The design provides a cleaner and more consistent experience across the platform. The functionality improvements help you navigate and use the project listing page more efficiently.

Note: This is a gradual rollout that will first affect those users already using the new Snyk UI with a wider global rollout to follow soon.

So what can you expect?

* Improved filtering insight, app context, and project identification: the new design accommodates project collections while aligning with how users navigate their projects
* Clearly identifiable filters allow users to get to their projects quicker whilst retaining the context they’re working in
* Page header and breadcrumbs let users know where they are in the app
* Searchable and sortable projects list improves the scannable nature of the page

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/new_project_list_page_ui.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Share and bookmark filtered versions of the page: After users have applied filters in the project listing page, they can bookmark the link and share it with other users within their organization
* Exclusion of folders when importing a project: folders can be excluded when importing a project through the UI (SCA and Container only)
* Enhanced deletion: Targets, including their projects, can be deleted now
* Easier re-import: Users can retry the import of a target should anything derail it
* Sort by test recency: Projects inside a target can be sorted by name and latest test to find what is needed faster

For more information, head to the [project documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects).

## Re-issuing GPG keys and signing certificates for Snyk CLI

January 11, 2023

**New**

For every Snyk CLI release, we publish signed binaries for Windows and macOS, and GPG signed SHA-256 checksums for all artifacts.

These important measures ensure the authenticity and integrity of the Snyk CLI prior to use.

Following [a recent incident](https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/) impacting our CI/CD vendor, we have rotated our GPG keys and are re-issuing our Windows and macOS signing certificates for Snyk CLI. Going forward, every Snyk CLI release will be signed with these new certificates, which replace the previous ones used.

**No malicious activity or leak is believed to have occurred, we are taking these steps out of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers’ safety.**

#### **What do I need to do?**

Our new GPG keys should be used for verifying checksums from [CLI release 1.1082.0](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1082.0) onwards.

If you have previously imported our public GPG key, please delete and re-import, via:

```shell
gpg --delete-keys 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569

gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys A22665FB96CAB0E0973604C83676C4B8289C296E
```

Otherwise, no action is necessary.

For more information, see [getting started with the CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-cli).
