## Compliance reporting and Issue triage for Snyk Cloud and Snyk IaC

December 29, 2022

**New**

We‚Äôre excited to share that Snyk Cloud and Snyk IaC ([integrated](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/integrated-infrastructure-as-code)) now support compliance reporting and issue triage for [10+ compliance standards](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-cloud/cloud-compliance#supported-compliance-standards) - including CIS Benchmarks for AWS and Google Cloud, PCI DSS and SOC 2.

We‚Äôve added a **Cloud Compliance Issues report** to the [reporting beta](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-reports/reporting-beta-2022/available-snyk-reports) that enables users to select a compliance standard, and view compliance controls and corresponding Issue counts. To fix these issues, the report links directly to the [Cloud Issues UI](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-cloud/snyk-cloud-issues/view-cloud-issues-in-the-snyk-web-ui), with appropriate filters set for faster investigation and remediation.

**Note:** All users with access to the reporting beta will see the Cloud Compliance Issues report, with an appropriate message if you do not have Snyk Cloud and/or integrated IaC enabled. Please reach out to your account team for questions about access.

## Snyk Container - Application dependencies CLI scan by default

December 14, 2022

**Improved**

We are excited to share that starting from January 24th, 2023, when using the `snyk container test/monitor` CLI commands, we will scan for [application dependencies](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/getting-around-the-snyk-container-ui/detecting-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images) by default, which will allow you to get a full picture of the security issues within your images.

[Here](https://snyk.io/blog/securing-container-applications-using-the-snyk-cli/) are all the details you need to know about this change to ensure your testing and automation work as expected and you understand all your options.

## Container Registry Agent adding HTTPS configuration

November 29, 2022

**Improved**

We are excited to announce the improvement of our Container Registry Agent (CRA). Previously CRA could only be configured to run an HTTP server. Now, The Container Registry Agent runs an HTTP server by default. Additionally, it is configurable to run an HTTPS server for local connections.

This new improvement allows the broker image and CRA to communicate in HTTPS. Please download the latest CRA image in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/container-registry-agent) and follow the configuration instruction in [Snyk Public Docs](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/container-registry-agent-advanced-configuration#container-registry-agent-server-https-configuration).

***

## Improved Fingerprinting for Snyk Code

November 17, 2022

**Improved**

We are excited to announce improvements with the way fingerprinting is done in [Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code)!

A fingerprinting algorithm is a procedure that maps an arbitrarily large data item to a much shorter bit string, its fingerprint, that uniquely identifies the original data for all practical purposes.

With our [reporting functionality recently in Open Beta](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-new-reporting-beta/), the new fingerprinting will make the experience of viewing and retrieving issues data even easier and smoother.

**Note**, due to this, in the Code Reporting, you may see large numbers of both new and resolved issues.

We advise you to retest your projects.

Once retesting:

* Many issues will get new, ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù issue IDs (in the context of that Snyk project) and this will mean their old issue IDs will disappear.
* Reporting uses issue IDs to track their status, so this changeover will appear as a lot of issues being new and a lot of issues being resolved.
* These numbers also may not match exactly since, in the past, multiple issues could share the same old issue ID but that will no longer be the case.
* The URL of the issue on the Project page will stay the same - so any open tickets via Jira will remain linked.

## Snyk Container - Improved Go binaries scanning

September 8, 2022

**Improved**

With the release of the Snyk CLI version 1.999.0, support for Go binary scanning in containers has been extended and improved. As long as binaries are built with go module support enabled, Snyk now also scans Cgo binaries, binaries with stripped debug information (the -ldflags="-s -w" compiler setting), binaries built with the -trimpath compiler setting and binaries with vendored dependencies.

Read more about application dependency scanning in our [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/getting-around-the-snyk-container-ui/detecting-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images).

***

## Projects page performance enhancements: pagination and grouping

September 6, 2022

**Improved**

To improve the overall Projects page performance, Snyk added pagination and the ability to organize projects.

Currently, every request or filter you apply on the Projects page involves retrieving all the targets and projects for the page. For enterprise users with hundreds of thousands of imported projects, this can result in prolonged load times. Adding pagination can improve the Projects page load time by up to 90%.

View our [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-web-ui/introduction-to-snyk-projects) for more details.

## Improved public repo monitoring

August 15, 2022

**Improved**

A new version of Snyk‚Äôs Monitor Public GitHub Repos feature has been released to improve scalability and platform support. Using this feature you are able to monitor public repositories not directly owned by your SCM account through a GitHub integration connected by a user in your Snyk organization. With this release your followed projects will now trigger notifications according to your preferences, and be visible in reports.

Existing monitored public GitHub repos will be migrated, and no action is required for organizations where a user has already connected a GitHub SCM integration.

If you do not already have a GitHub integration connected, action is required to maintain recurring testing of these projects. Projects without access to a GitHub integration will remain static and their scan results will not reflect changes made at the public GitHub repository. Instructions for adding a GitHub integration can be found in our [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/github-integration).

For more information about this feature, see the üìñ [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/github-read-only-projects).

***

## Nexus Repository Manager integration

July 19, 2022

**New**

We are excited to announce the new [Nexus Repository Manager integration](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/private-registry-integrations/nexus-repo-manager-setup) for Snyk Open Source! üöÄ

This integration enables Snyk to resolve all direct and transitive dependencies of packages hosted in Nexus when testing Maven projects imported from Git, and calculate more complete and accurate dependency graphs.

Snyk will also use this integration to access private dependencies when creating Pull/Merge Requests, and update npm/yarn lockfiles using the correct URLs.

This release fully supports Nexus 3.x. Support for Nexus 2.15 and above is in open beta.

The integration is available on Enterprise plans.

To get started, see the üìñ [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/private-registry-integrations/nexus-repo-manager-setup).

## Snyk Container - CLI application vulnerabilities are now supported in a JSON output

July 12, 2022

**New**

In CLI version 1.962.0, when using the `--json` flag together with the `--app-vulns` flag, we now list operating system as well as application vulnerabilities in a JSON format. Before the change, using the `--app-vulns` flag together with the `--json` was not possible.

This improvement is one step towards supporting an upcoming change that will allow the CLI to scan application vulnerabilities by default (without the need to specify the `--app-vulns` flag).

We have added a new JSON key called ‚Äòapplications‚Äô that includes an array of all application scan results. The new JSON format will look like the following:

```json
`{
  "vulnerabilities": [],
  "ok": true,
  "dependencyCount": 13,
  ...
  "packageManager": "apk",
  "summary": "No known vulnerabilities",
  "uniqueCount": 0,
  "projectName": "docker-image|snykgoof/os-app",
  "platform": "linux/amd64",
  "path": "snykgoof/os-app:node-snykin/os-app",
  "applications": [
    {
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          A bunch of vulns
        },
        ...
      ],
      "ok": false,
      "dependencyCount": 116,
      "packageManager": "yarn",
      "summary": "14 vulnerable dependency paths",
      "uniqueCount": 9,
      "targetFile": "/app2/package.json",
      "projectName": "snykin",
      "displayTargetFile": "/app2/package.json",
      "path": "snykgoof/os-app:node-snykin"
    }
  ]
}`
```

## Changes to the default behaviour for path arguments for Snyk IaC test scans

July 11, 2022

**Improved**

#### What's Changing?

We are changing the behaviour of snyk iac test to only scan files within your current working directory.

Currently when a user runs snyk iac test ../my-folder the command will be executed. However after the change if you try to run snyk iac test ../my-folder it will return an error.

We are making this change to create a more consistent and predictable way of how we group and display findings from scanning your directories and files.

Please see [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code/test-your-configuration-files) for more information.

#### When is this happening?

Using path arguments outside of your current working directory is unsupported from CLI v1.968.0 onwards.

## Snyk IaC Settings page now available to ‚ÄòCollaborator‚Äô user roles

June 20, 2022

**New**

Users with ‚Äò**Collaborator**‚Äô permissions can now view and make changes to IaC settings in the Snyk app Infrastructure as Code setting sidebar.

#### **This includes:**

* Enabling config file detection.
* Customizing rule severity settings.

***

## Changes to the default behaviour for path arguments for Snyk IaC test scans

June 10, 2022

**Improved**

#### **What's Changing?**

We are changing the behaviour of snyk iac test to only scan files within your current working directory.

Currently when a user runs `snyk iac test ../my-folder` the command will be executed. However after the change if you try to run `snyk iac test ../my-folder` it will return an error.

We are making this change to create a more consistent and predictable way of how we group and display findings from scanning your directories and files.

Please see [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code/test-your-configuration-files) for more information.

#### **When is this happening?**

We will change this behaviour on 11th July 2022.

## Unknown versions vulnerability reporting fix

June 9, 2022

**Fix**

In certain situations ([Why does my Maven package show Unknown version](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/4934749708829)), Maven, Gradle and SBT projects imported via Git can contain dependencies where Snyk is unable to determine the version.

On Feb 17th, 2022, a change was released to label these versions as `unknown`. This caused Snyk to report such dependencies as being affected by _all_ the vulnerabilities for that package, and may have led to false positives for issues not relevant to the actual version used.

On June 17th, 2022, we will roll out a fix with the following changes:

1. Stop reporting vulnerabilities for dependencies with `unknown` versions
2. Add a UI component to project pages to make it clear when they contain dependencies with `unknown` versions

When this change is deployed, you may see the number of vulnerabilities in your projects go down.

Note: you can see dependencies with `unknown` versions in Reports. While it is not currently possible to filter dependencies by version in the Reports UI, you can export as CSV for analysis.

***

## Improved Snyk CLI accuracy for Gradle projects

June 8, 2022

**Improved**

#### **What's changing?**

Currently, the Snyk CLI excludes Gradle configurations set as `isResolvable: true && isConsumable: true`. The reason for excluding these is because according to [docs.gradle.org](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring\_dependencies.html#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs) about declaring dependencies, this combination is deprecated and shouldn‚Äôt be used.

However, many applications still include configurations like these, so we are changing behaviour to include them in Snyk CLI scans.

#### **What will you see?**

You should see more accurate results in the Snyk CLI for applications using `isResolvable: true && isConsumable: true` configurations.

This might mean an increase in the number of dependencies, and/or different resolved versions for existing dependencies.

By reporting more and different versions of dependencies, the number of vulnerabilities may also potentially increase.

#### **When is this happening?**

This change will be released in a new version of the Snyk CLI on June 16th.

***

## Oracle Linux Security Data Improvements - Upcoming Changes

April 12, 2022

**Improved**

We would like to inform you about upcoming changes to how we provide security data for the [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) platforms.

As part of a continual effort to improve our container security data, we are changing how we provide information for Oracle Linux vulnerabilities. Prior to these changes, we provided information on Oracle Linux vulnerabilities only through Erreta Linux Security Advisories (ELSA), which are collections of fixed CVEs. We are moving from ELSA, and instead will present issues based on the individual CVEs.

#### The following are some of the key features of this change:

* **Enhanced accuracy**: By showing individual CVEs instead of an ELSA, which may cover more than one CVE, you will have more details about each vulnerability Snyk detects.
* **Enriched metadata**: Showing individual CVEs allows us to provide enriched vulnerability metadata on these CVEs, like [Exploit Maturity](https://snyk.io/blog/prioritizing-container-vulnerabilities-with-exploit-maturity/), [Social Trends](https://snyk.io/blog/social-media-for-security-intelligence/) and more.
* **Oracle‚Äôs security analysis**: We will provide the severity of the issues as defined by the Oracle Security team (Low, Moderate, Important, Critical), in addition to the severity determined by NVD, as part of the [Relative Importance](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/snyk-container-security-basics/understanding-linux-vulnerability-severity) feature.

#### Important notes:

* Old data will no longer be accessible once the new data is available.
* The current unique public Snyk IDs will be obsolete.
* The number of issues will increase significantly as a result of this change - you may notice an increase in the Reports graphs.

The rollout will start tomorrow, on April 13th. After the change, rescanning of the project is required (either a manual test or scheduled scanning for monitored projects).

***

## Improved UI for Snyk IaC

April 11, 2023

**Improved**

Snyk IaC has a new look üéâ. Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes files now have a detailed row view displaying one code snippet per issue, making it easier to identify the issue in code and creating consistency across the UI for Helm chart files and Snyk Code projects.

#### **What has changed?**

* Filter by severity: sort by severity of High, Medium, and Low
* Work by misconfiguration: the file is separated into misconfiguration issues and code snippets, instead of a code block of the entire file containing issues.
* ‚ÄòIgnore‚Äô button is now located underneath code snippet

To temporarily continue using the previous UI view, you can opt-out of the update via our feature flag under Snyk Preview. Opting out is a temporary action as the previous UI will be deprecated in a month‚Äôs time.

## CVE-2022-22965 - ‚ÄúSpringShell‚Äù RCE vulnerability in spring-beans before 5.2.20/5.3.18

March 31, 2022

[CVE-2022-22965](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGSPRINGFRAMEWORK-2436751) was reserved for a 0-day RCE vulnerability in `spring-beans` as Spring team officially acknowledged the vulnerability and issued a fixed version for the currently known exploit. Scan your applications with Snyk to find out if you are vulnerable and mitigate by upgrading Spring to the latest version.

All Snyk projects are being re-tested, but we recommend to re-test your projects actively to make sure the process is done. While there are several partial mitigations published online currently, we highly recommend upgrading to a fixed version to protect against this vulnerability.

The Snyk Security team is continuously investigating the issue, as we expect further exploits and bypasses to show up. Please look for updates in our [advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGSPRINGFRAMEWORK-2436751) and on [spring blog](https://snyk.io/blog/is-there-such-a-thing-as-spring4shell/).

## Credential format changes for Snyk Apps

March 30, 2022

**Improved**, **open beta**

The credential formats for **Snyk Apps** have changed, to be recognizable and compatible with third-party secret scanning systems.

Specifically, the format of **client secrets** and **refresh tokens** have changed. Both credential types now include a prefix (`snyk_`) followed by an identifier (`cs_` for client secrets, `rt_` for refresh tokens) and a trailing version number (currently `_v1`).

To illustrate, the credential types adhere to the following _general form_:

* For **refresh tokens**: `^snyk_rt_.+_v1$` (e.g. `snyk_rt_8R6aIT88713YlnZ5loA3rO5nFkzap0rs3miIPFb0J78_JOCRYo3olA5cubc5jYxy8R7xhf9m9cP8wwJ3FYy4Kis_v1`)
* For **client secrets**: `^snyk_cs_.+_v1$` (e.g. `snyk_cs_FDals7bwaCdSIW_6sOaV92yQouJ8GlztpuBZLLpyEp80_v1`)

Existing credentials will continue to work. To take advantage of the new client secret format, you will need to rotate the client secret for your Snyk App using [the `POST /orgs/{org_id}/apps/{client_id}/secrets` API endpoint](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2022-03-11%7Eexperimental#post-/orgs/-org\_id-/apps/-client\_id-/secrets), new refresh tokens will reflect the latest format automatically, you may exchange an existing refresh token for a new one using [the `POST /oauth2/token` API endpoint](https://snykoauth2.docs.apiary.io/#reference/apps/app-tokens/token-exchange-&-refresh).

You can learn more about Snyk Apps, currently available as an open beta, [here](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-apps).

## Detect infrastructure drift and unmanaged resources in the Snyk CLI

March 25, 2022

**New**, **Open beta**

Drift management for Snyk IaC is now available in beta üéâ. You can now detect drift of cloud infrastructure and unmanaged resources in your cloud environments for Terraform (AWS, GCP, Azure).

`snyk iac describe` is the new CLI command available (starting with version 1.882.0) that produces a report of drifted resources and unmanaged resources.

With the report, you can:

* ensure that the various desired states of cloud infrastructure actually match what's really running in the cloud environments.
* discover cloud resources that are not yet under Terraform management, or increase visibility about what changed since the last deployment, potentially introducing misconfigurations.
* bring resources under control, so they can be audited for misconfiguration by Snyk IaC, closing one more code-to-cloud lifecycle loop.

For usage and constraints, please see the [product documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/detect-drift-and-manually-created-resources), an [introduction blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/infrastructure-drift-detection-mitigation/) or the [Snyk CLI help](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/iac/iac-describe).

## Snyk Wizard and Snyk Protect removal

March 2, 2022

Starting from 31 March 2022, the `protect` and `wizard` commands in Snyk CLI will be removed and will not be available in future CLI versions.

#### **Why are we removing wizard and protect?**

Both `wizard` and `protect` are legacy commands that have better, well-documented alternatives available.

#### **What should you do?**

We recommend you use [snyk ignore](https://snyk.co/ueln8) instead of the `wizard` command and use the [@snyk/protect](https://snyk.co/ueln7) package instead of the `protect` command.

Alternatively, if you need to use `snyk wizard` or `snyk protect`, you will have to use any version of the CLI that was released before 31 March 2022.

Snyk is here to help! If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please reach out to [support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us).

## Snyk IaC - Terraform AWS provider update

February 16, 2022

**Fix**

Snyk Infrastructure as Code now supports the new Terraform AWS v4.0 provider.

With v4.0, the AWS Terraform provider changes how the S3 service is specified by dividing the configuration across several Terraform resources.

The Snyk security rules for S3 have been updated to support both v3 and v4 of the AWS provider.

* If you have defined an instance of a S3 bucket in the same Terraform file, you will benefit from these changes automatically on your next scan.
* If you have spread your definition across multiple files, please see the [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/scan-terraform-files/terraform-aws-provider-support) for more details.

***

## Debian Severity Improvements - Upcoming Changes

February 14, 2022

**Improved**

We would like to let you know about upcoming changes to how we provide severity information for **Debian vulnerabilities**.

When Snyk determines the severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical) of a Linux vulnerability for the Snyk Container product, we consider multiple factors:

* Snyk's internal analysis.
* An assessment of the severity provided by the Linux distribution maintainer‚Äôs security team.
* The severity of the vulnerability as assessed by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

In certain cases, NVD may assign a different CVSS vector and severity score than the security maintainers of a particular Linux distribution. When this occurs, we prioritize and use the severity as determined by the Linux distribution maintainers as described in our relative importance feature. Specifically regarding Debian vulnerabilities, we take into account the "urgency" field. The change discussed here is that on top of the usage of this ‚Äúurgency‚Äù field, we will now be taking into account if Debian marks a vulnerability as a ‚Äú**minor issue**‚Äù.

This means that we will have an improved and more accurate calculation for Debian vulnerabilities‚Äô severity based on multiple factors of their [relative importance](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/snyk-container-security-basics/understanding-linux-vulnerability-severity). Any future and existing issues that are marked as ‚Äúminor issues‚Äù will be classified as ‚ÄúLow‚Äù severity issues.

For example: In analyzing this vulnerability: [SNYK-DEBIAN11-GLIBC-2340922](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIAN11-GLIBC-2340922), although NVD assigned the [CVE-2022-23218](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23218) a 9.8 score (Critical), the Debian Security Team concluded that this [vulnerability](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23218) is a minor issue for Debian users. In this case, we will rely on Debian's analysis, and it will be marked as a low severity vulnerability.

Important notes:

* After this change, the previous severity data relevant to each vulnerability will no longer be accessible.
* Using the Reports feature, you might find that the number of Low issues is increasing, while other severities are decreasing.
* Due to the fact that the Priority Score is calculated also using the severity of a vulnerability, this score will vary accordingly.

The rollout will begin on **February 15th**. After the change, a rescan is needed (either a manual test or a scheduled scan for monitored projects).

***

## Snyk Code in Visual Studio

January 18, 2022

**New**

We are excited to announce that Snyk Code is now available in Visual Studio as well! You can scan your first party code and enjoy the blazingly fast Snyk Code scans using Snyk‚Äôs Visual Studio extension. The Visual Studio extension is available for Windows and supports [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner-vs) and with a separate extension the [latest 2022 version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner-vs-2022).

You can easily install the Snyk extension by navigating to the marketplace or within the IDE itself just like any other Visual Studio extension. If you are using a previous version of the Snyk extension, Snyk Code is enabled through the extension settings.

## Ending Snyk CLI support for Node.js v10

January 17, 2022

#### **Starting from March 7, 2022, Snyk CLI will no longer support Node.js v10.**

As a general security best practice, we recommend using runtime environments which are maintained and up-to-date. Node.js ended long-term support for Node.js v10 on April 2021. This means it has not been receiving bug fixes and security updates for close to a year.

#### **What does this mean?**

Starting from the date stated above, using Snyk CLI npm installations with Node.js v10, either locally or as part of an automated build pipeline might fail in unexpected ways.

If you are using our [official integrations](https://github.com/snyk/snyk#install-as-a-part-of-a-snyk-cli-integration) or binary installations of Snyk CLI you will not be affected and do not need to take any action.

#### **What should you do?**

If you are affected by this change, we recommend upgrading Node.js to the current stable version, which is Node.js v16 as of writing. We do not recommend upgrading to Node.js v17 as odd numbered versions are not considered stable.

Snyk is here to help! If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please reach out to support.
