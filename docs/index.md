# Snyk Product Updates

***

## PR Comments (Closed Beta) are now available for BitBucket Server

September 25, 2024

**New**, **Closed Beta**

PR Comments for Snyk PR Checks, [announced in Closed Beta](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/pr-comments-for-snyk-pr-checks-are-now-in-closed-beta-292934) earlier this year, now supports BitBucket Server!&#x20;

With this new feature enabled, customers using Snyk PR Checks will receive a new PR comment on each Pull Request that summarizes the most recent PR check results according to the type of check and severity of findings.

## High-Context Inline Comments are available in Closed Beta

September 23, 2024

**New**, **Closed Beta**

We are announcing the release of High-Context Inline Comments as part of our ongoing initiatives to enhance the pull request experience. This new feature brings detailed security findings directly into your PRs, streamlining the process of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities without leaving your SCM. With High-Context Inline Comments, you‚Äôll see each SAST security finding alongside key information such as CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and Priority Score. This makes it easier to act on vulnerabilities quickly, reducing the need for developers to switch between platforms and improving your team‚Äôs workflow.

Comments are available to the following SCM integrations:

* GitHub: GitHub OAuth, GitHub Enterprise (PAT), and GitHub Cloud App
* Bitbucket: Bitbucket Cloud (PAT), Bitbucket Cloud App, Bitbucket Server

We‚Äôve expanded support to include Bitbucket Server, and for customers using Snyk Broker, we‚Äôve added support for both PR comments and High-Context Inline Comments.

<figure><img src="assets/inline-comments.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you‚Äôre interested in enabling this feature for your organization, please reach out to your account team. This is part of a series of enhancements designed to improve your developers‚Äô pull request experience with Snyk, and we remain committed to further improving it. If you were enabled for PR comments during Phase 1 as announced [here](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/pr-comments-for-snyk-pr-checks-are-now-in-closed-beta-292934), no further action is required.

## Simplified API Versioning

September 17, 2024

**New**

As Snyk's API landscape is evolving through [efforts to end-of-life v1 and non-GA REST APIs](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates), we need to also evolve our approach to REST API versioning. Therefore we are excited to announce an upcoming simplification to our API versioning scheme, aimed at reducing customer confusion while not introducing any breaking changes.

Please note that existing APIs and documentation will remain unchanged. Your existing integrations should be unaffected by this new versioning strategy.

After October 17th, no new experimental endpoints will be created. Instead, we are introducing new ‚Äú/closed-beta‚Äù endpoints. The purpose of these endpoints will be to provide a handful of users with a tech preview, giving them a sneak peek at new API features we're considering shipping to GA in the future. Closed beta endpoints will not be appropriate for integrations or major workloads.

For these new closed beta and beta endpoints, we will be enforcing our API deprecation policy at the sunset date. Removing outdated endpoints will simplify our API landscape further and hopefully reduce confusion when customers are trying to find the endpoint that fits their use case.

As part of versioning simplification, Snyk will expose one API specification per version-date, rather than one for each stability. New versions of the Snyk API will only be published when necessitated by breaking changes. For newer versions, you should only specify the date for beta versions, i.e 2024-08-02 rather than 2024-08-02\~beta. It's important to note that existing versions won't be affected by these changes; this new approach only applies to upcoming new versions.

We hope that this simplified API Versioning strategy will reduce customer confusion and make it easier to find the best endpoint for your use case.

## New filters in the IDE & CLI usage Report

September 5, 2024

**New**

The Developer IDE and CLI usage Report was enhanced with new filters, enabling deeper insights into Snyk IDE and CLI adoption in your company. The new filters include:

* **Environment filter:** analyze usage for specific coding environments, such as VS Code, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and CLI.
* **Snyk product filter:** refine the viewed metrics by focusing on the specific Snyk Products that executed the scan.

With these new filters, you can explore additional use-cases, such as:

* Comparing scan adoption by organizations for specific Snyk products or IDEs.
* Reviewing developers usage trend by Snyk product within selected IDEs.
* Measuring IDE usage according to the Snyk product of interest.

To learn more about the Developer IDE and CLI usage Report visit our [product docs](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/reporting/available-snyk-reports#developer-ide-and-cli-usage). For any questions, please contact your Snyk account team.

## Universal Broker Early Access

September 4, 2024

**Improved**, **Early Access**

We are pleased to announce the Broker improvement: Universal Broker!

The **Universal Broker** is an innovative improvement to the Broker, providing a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform to alleviate management of Snyk Broker deployments and connections.

Previously, Snyk customers encountered difficulties managing multiple broker connections, leading to configuration challenges and risks. Universal Broker simplifies this process by allowing customers to consolidate all system types into a single Broker instance. Additionally, by implementing authenticated clients and abstracting sensitive values from the user interface, Snyk reaffirms its commitment to security.

By safeguarding credentials and providing a more intuitive user experience, this update aims to enhance overall efficiency and security.

The Universal Broker is particularly beneficial for customers who prioritize GitHub Server App or find managing multiple broker clients cumbersome.

Check out the [user documentation here!](https://docs.snyk.io/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/universal-broker)

## Improved Gradle scan accuracy now in Early Access

September 4, 2024

**Improved**

We are pleased to announce that improved accuracy for Gradle projects imported via git integrations is now in Early Access üôå

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a powerful build tool with complex configuration and dependency management features, which has traditionally meant the only way to get good SCA results is to scan in CI/CD pipelines.

With this Early Access release, you can now also reliably scan your Gradle applications simply by [connecting Snyk to your git repositories](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/import-project-repository).

This makes it easier to roll out at scale across your organisation, and to benefit from shift-left, developer friendly features such as [pull request checks](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks).

For more details on improved Gradle scanning, and how to get started, see our [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/java-and-kotlin/git-repositories-with-maven-and-gradle).

***

## New versions of Snyk IDE plugins

August 29, 2024

**New**

We are pleased to announce the latest stable releases for each supported IDE plugin:

* [Visual Studio Code v2.18.1](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner\&ssr=false#version-history)
* [JetBrains v2.9.0](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10972-snyk-security)

* [Visual Studio 1.1.63](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner-vs-2022) (only VS 2022)

As part of these releases, we are happy to conclude the work announced previously:

* [OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://updates.snyk.io/coming-soon-oauth-2-0-authentication-by-default-in-cli-and-ide-plugins-299321)
* [Severity change annotations](https://updates.snyk.io/coming-soon-severity-change-annotations-in-ides-for-oss-findings-299257)

In addition to big features, these releases contain multiple bug fixes and performance improvements:

* Significantly improved JetBrains performance by moving business logic from the UI thread to the separate one on the background
* Unified and Improved rendering of IAC findings in all VSC and JetBrains

Snyk documentation has been updated with How-to pages about authentication. For example, [JetBrains authentication](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/jetbrains-plugins/authentication-for-the-jetbrains-plugins)

We encourage everyone to upgrade to the newest versions.

## Vulnerabilities Detail report format

August 28, 2024

**Improved**

We wanted to share an update on how users can interact with issue details from within the Vulnerabilities Detail report. To improve usability and consistency across the product, the nested table pattern previously used in this report has been replaced with a drawer. Clicking the vulnerability name in the report table will now activate a drawer with increased area to display details, pagination, and affected projects. Also within the drawer is an additional link to the Issue Details report, with included context, for deeper exploration.

## Announcing Snyk CLI v1.1293.0

August 28, 2024

**New**

We are pleased to announce the latest stable [Snyk CLI release v1.1293.0](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1293.0).

We are introducing the following new features in this version. To learn more about bug fixes, please reference the [release notes](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1293.0).

### **Introducing OAuth by default for standalone installation**

OAuth support has been available since [v.1.1267.0](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1267.0) and from v.1.1293.0 onwards, Snyk CLI will authenticate a local user via OAuth by default. This change strengthens security and access controls, and can be used in both local development as well as where the CLI is integrated directly into CI/CD pipelines. [See user docs for more information](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/auth#auth-type-less-than-type-greater-than).

### **Improved environment configuration**

Introducing a new config subcommand, the experience is now easier and more consistent to configure the environment used in the CLI. By default, the Snyk CLI connects to [https://api.snyk.io/](https://api.snyk.io/) and for users using regional hosting or on premise instances, it‚Äôs as simple as calling snyk config environment . For more information and to understand how this reduces the impact of misconfiguration, [see the docs here](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/config-environment).

### **Support for license issues and improved error details in SBOM test**

We now support returning license issues in addition to vulnerabilities when using [sbom test](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/sbom-test). When scanning a CycloneDX or SPDX SBOM, Snyk will detect the license for each component in the SBOM and return issues according to the defined or default license policy for your organization. In addition, we‚Äôve made improvements to CLI errors returned when SBOMs cannot be processed by Snyk.

### **Improved SBOM generation for Container application dependencies**

We have improved the accuracy of SBOM generation for Snyk Container. When using [snyk container sbom](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/container-sbom), Snyk scans and generates an SBOM for operating system dependencies as well as application dependencies in your image by default. Prior to this improvement, there were limitations in the underlying analysis causing application dependencies to be omitted under certain conditions.

### **Enrich CLI results for IaC+ with successful items**

The CLI output for Snyk IaC tests now displays not only the failed rules but also the successful rules, providing visibility into the comprehensive scan coverage and reassurance that configurations are correctly defined (for validation purposes).

### **pnpm CLI support in Early Access**

We now support [testing and monitoring of pnpm projects using the Snyk CLI](https://updates.snyk.io/cli-support-for-pnpm-now-in-early-access-297716). Customers wanting to try this Early Access feature can enable it using [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/snyk-preview). [Details are available in user docs](https://docs.snyk.io/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/javascript/javascript-for-open-source#pnpm).

You can learn more about Snyk CLI [release channels](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/releases-and-channels-for-the-snyk-cli) in user documentation.

## CLI support for pnpm now in Early Access

August 28, 2024

**New**

We are pleased to announce that CLI support for [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is now available in Early Access üéâ

`pnpm` is a fast, efficient Node.js package manager, with excellent support for managing large monorepos. Managing security risks in pnpm projects is as vital as with any other tool, and we are excited to begin supporting it.

When the feature is enabled via [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/snyk-preview), you can scan pnpm projects with the Snyk CLI stable version `v1.1293.0` and higher.

Here's a summary of what's supported, see the [docs](https://docs.snyk.io/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/javascript/javascript-for-open-source#pnpm) for more details‚Ä¶

* pnpm versions `7`, `8` and `9`
* `snyk test` and `snyk monitor` CLI commands
* pnpm [catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs)
* pnpm [workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), using the `--all-projects` CLI option
* Standard CLI options for Node.js projects, e.g. `--dev` for dev dependencies

Have fun! ü§ó

## Coming soon: OAuth 2.0 authentication by default in CLI and IDE plugins

August 23, 2024

**Improved**

We are happy to announce that the OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol will be enabled by default for the new release of CLI and IDE plugins.

### What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth2 is an open standard for enabling secure, controlled data access. This protocol relies on a pair of short-lived tokens with a built-in refresh mechanism instead of long-lived tokens. It's highly regarded across the industry.

This improvement will be included in the upcoming release of the **CLI** on **Wednesday, August 28th**, and the **IDE plugins** for Visual Studio Code, Jetbrains IDEs, Visual Studio, and Eclipse on **Thursday, August 29th**.

Things you should know about CLI authentication:

* Active users of the CLI will continue to be authenticated
* The `snyk auth` command, when run locally, will use short-lived tokens to grant user access to Snyk CLI
* CI/CD use cases will continue as is for environment variable SNYK\_TOKEN as well as `snyk auth`
* API keys and personal access tokens (PATs) experience remains unchanged

Things you should know about IDE plugin authentication:

* Active users will be prompted to re-authenticate upon the plugin's upgrade.
* There will be a temporary opportunity to return to the token-based authentication in the plugin‚Äôs settings.

### Troubleshooting

A new browser tab does not open automatically:

* Copy a provided URL to the clipboard
* Open a new browser tab manually and paste the URL
* Continue the authentication procedure

These changes will be reflected in Snyk documentation over the next week.

***

## Coming soon: Severity change annotations in IDEs for OSS findings

August 22, 2024

**Improved**

OSS Security policies can be configured to change the severity of matched vulnerabilities. (See [Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/policies/security-policies/security-policy-actions)).

Till now, this change was not visible in IDE plugins.

With the new release, IDE plugins will show that "severity was changed to‚Ä¶" and mention the policy name that affected it.

This UI improvement is included in the upcoming release of plugins for **Visual Studio Code**, **IntelliJ IDE**, and **Eclipse** on Thursday, August 29th.

***

## Multi-Licensing Severity Logic update

August 22, 2024

**Improved**

We are happy to announce an improvement to Snyk's license scanning capabilities.

Currently, Snyk displays the issue with the lowest severity as the default for multi and dual licenses with OR and AND conditions. To enhance accuracy and ensure that higher severity licenses are appropriately flagged, we will be updating our default Snyk policy logic.

Starting **November 19th**, Snyk will display the issue with the **highest severity as the default in cases of multi-licensing**. This change will help you better identify and address potential risks in your open-source projects.

Please note that this default Snyk policy for multi and dual licenses is applied to all organizations or projects with a license policy.

We strongly recommend that you tailor a customized license policy that fits your company‚Äôs compliance, legal requirements, and needs. Snyk does not offer legal advice regarding this default license policy.

Please see [open-source license compliance](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/snyk-open-source/scan-open-source-libraries-and-licenses/open-source-license-compliance) documentation for more information.

## Improved accuracy and speed in Snyk Code

August 22, 2024

**Improved**

As part of ongoing efforts to make the Snyk Code engine faster, easier to use, and more accurate‚Äîwe‚Äôre introducing an optimization that will improve analysis speed by 120%.

In addition to providing you faster feedback, we're also solving a longstanding precision issue that we know leads to false positives in production today. On average, you will see a 5% reduction in false positives for C++ and minor improvements to C#.

This change will be released on **September 4th, 2024**. Once released, no action is necessary‚Äîyou'll begin to observe improvements in your tests going forward.

***

## Coming soon - Simplified Snyk Code taint flow view

August 22, 2024

**Improved**

When viewing a ‚Äútaint vulnerability‚Äù in Snyk Code, we provide a visualisation of the dataflow between the source and the sink. This helps you to get an understanding of the reported vulnerability, decide whether it a true positive and work on a fix.

In some cases, dataflow steps that are unnecessary for understanding the reported vulnerability can be added, which can make it harder to understand and mitigate the reported vulnerability.

Soon we will be rolling out an improvement which simplifies the dataflow view in the web app by showing only the steps necessary to understand taint flow vulnerabilities.

This UI improvement will become available to all Snyk Code users on **Wednesday August 28th**, and no other action is required.

***

## Introducing Quick Filters for Asset Inventory

August 22, 2024

**New**

We are pleased to introduce the new Quick Filters feature in the Asset Inventory. This feature is designed to streamline your filtering experience and speed up workflows, helping you focus on what matters most.

### What is this feature about?

With Quick Filters, users can now quickly narrow down their Asset Inventory using predefined filters, helping users identify the most critical assets and eliminating the need to manually set multiple criteria.

After selecting a Quick Filter, the filters are automatically populated with the relevant attributes and values. Users can then apply the filters directly or further customize them to meet their specific needs. For those who prefer a manual approach, the option to set filters manually, as before, remains available.

***

## Announcing general availability of Workspaces, and improved SCM integration accuracy and reliability

August 19, 2024

**New**

We are excited to announce the General Availability of [**Workspaces**](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/workspaces-for-scm-integrations). Following a successful open beta [announced previously](https://updates.snyk.io/open-beta-availability-of-git-repository-cloning-275373), this enhancement significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of Snyk‚Äôs SCM integration results, especially for large-scale enterprise environments. This capability also supports additional functionality and improvements we have planned in the future.

To maximize the benefits of this feature and provide a consistent user experience, **Snyk strongly recommends enabling Workspaces** across all your Snyk Organizations. To facilitate this, over the coming days we will be incrementally rolling out the ability to manage Workspaces at both the Snyk Organization _and_ Snyk Group level.

Going forwards, Workspaces will be enabled by default for all new Snyk Organizations. Existing Organizations will be gradually transitioned to this new approach in the coming weeks. To request a deferral from the default settings, please opt-out [**here**](https://forms.gle/qGg43DYyAHBHGp7T7) by September 20th, 2024.

For detailed information on Workspaces and its security measures, more details can be found in [the docs](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/workspaces-for-scm-integrations), including information on [how Workspaces supports more _reliable_ results](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/workspaces-for-scm-integrations#how-workspaces-supports-more-reliable-results), [how Workspaces supports more _accurate_ results](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/workspaces-for-scm-integrations#how-workspaces-supports-more-accurate-results), and [safeguards Snyk puts in place to ensure data is secure](https://docs.snyk.io/working-with-snyk/how-snyk-handles-your-data#safeguards-snyk-puts-in-place-to-ensure-data-is-secure).

If you have any questions or require further assistance, please [contact Support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us), or your dedicated Snyk account representative.

## End of Life Announcement: 4 week extension on planned removal of certain Snyk container images

August 9, 2024

**Deprecated**

In May 2022 we announced the deprecation and end of life (EOL) plan for Snyk‚Äôs CLI container images ([snyk/snyk-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-cli)); following that, in May 2024 we announced the plan to EOL some additional Snyk container images (a subset of [snyk/snyk](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk) images) with out-of-date open source components. We are adjusting our timeframe for the EOL.

Originally set for 12-Aug-2024, we are now extending the date to 09-Sep-2024. This change ensures you have ample time for a smooth transition. If you do not use Snyk‚Äôs container images as part of your testing toolchain, you are not affected by this EOL notice.

### Here is what you need to know:

**Impacted Images:**

* [Snyk CLI Images which were deprecated in 2022](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-cli)

## Early Access of Reachability for JavaScript & TypeScript

August 6, 2024

**New**

We are pleased to announce that **Reachability** **for JavaScript & TypeScript** is now available in Early Access, bringing you another signal for evaluating risk across your **npm** **and** **Yarn** projects in Snyk.

Snyk‚Äôs [Reachability](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/reachable-vulnerabilities) will analyze your source code to determine whether or not a path can be found to the vulnerable function of an identified vulnerability, helping you better understand the likelihood of your project being exploited.

Whether used on its own or as part of a more holistic Risk-Based prioritization strategy using [Risk Score](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/risk-score), Reachability helps identify and prioritize higher risk vulnerabilities in your backlog of issues.

With this release, Reachability data for npm and Yarn is now available across several product surfaces:

* **Projects:** Filter results by Reachability to focus your list of Issues, or look for the Reachability badge to check an Issue‚Äôs reachability status at a glance.
* **Risk Score:** When a vulnerability is reachable, Snyk‚Äôs Risk Score will increase based on Reachability as a contextual factor.
* **Reporting:** View Group-level or Org-level Issue Details report to better understand your risk across a wider range of applications.
* **API:** Snyk‚Äôs Issues API now returns Reachability level where applicable.

To enable this feature, please see [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/snyk-preview).

## Computed Fixability to replace for Auto Fixable column in Snyk Reports

July 31, 2024

**Improved**

The Computed Fixability field (which is currently used to display Fixable SCA issues on the Projects page) will replace the Auto Fixable column in Reports to ensure consistent user experience across Snyk interfaces.

The computed fixability column Indicates whether an issue can be fixed based on the vulnerability remediation paths, and holds one of the values below:

* **Fixable:** There is a fix for all the identified issues, meaning that all detailed paths have remediation.
* **Partially fixable:** The issue has upgradable paths, but not all detailed paths have remediation.
* **No supported fix:** The issue has no upgradable paths.

This change will be carried out in the next few days.\
Please reach out to your account team for any questions, for further details about Computed Fixability, please visit [Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/snyk-open-source/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-fix-types).

## Final reminder on Snyk CLI Images and Snyk Images containing EoL software

July 25, 2024

**Deprecated**

This is the final reminder to Snyk customers using the following images which are **scheduled to be removed on the 12th of August 2024**:

* [Snyk CLI Images which were deprecated in 2022](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-cli)
* [A subset of Snyk Images containing EoL software](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images)

### Action Required

## The first cadence of the Snyk API end-of-life (EOL) program begins today

July 22, 2024

**New**

As we mentioned in our communications on [June 20th](https://updates.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-process-starting-july-22nd-2024-295308), we have rolled out Snyk‚Äôs API end-of-life program. We encourage you to [read the documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides) to understand what you should expect from the program, the [endpoints that will be sunsetted, and the timelines and milestones (including dates for brownouts)](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates).

Today we‚Äôre announcing that [the endpoints that have met the criteria for end-of-life](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates) will now be marked as deprecated, and the timeline for end-of-life has started. You can find the end-of-life dates and brownouts associated with the specific endpoints [in the documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates).

What you can expect from July 22nd is to see the documentation and endpoint responses state that the selected endpoints are being sunsetted (or the documentation will be removed completely); selected v1 endpoints will be fully removed on January 22nd 2025, and selected experimental endpoints will be fully removed on October 22nd 2024.

The endpoints will remain functional during the end-of-life timeline for existing customers but new customers will not be able to integrate with the endpoints. The endpoints will no longer be functional on January 22nd 2025 for v1 endpoints, and October 22nd 2024 experimental endpoints.

In addition, there will be periodic brownouts occurring for each of the selected endpoints, and you can find the dates, times, and durations of these brownouts in the [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates). Snyk will also share an announcement 2 weeks before a brownout occurs.

## AppRisk - More Application Context Integration

July 18, 2024

**New**

We're pleased to announce 4 AppRisk Integration for AppRisk to bring application context. Integrate with the IDPs and service catalogs application containing information that will add extra application context (teams, owners, repo to application mapping, etc.) into AppRisk.

What are the integrations included in this release?

1. [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/product/catalog)
2. [Atlassian Compass](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/compass/)
3. [Harness](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/software-catalog/)
4. [Datadog Service Catalog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/service\_catalog/)

What use cases are supported by this integration?

1. Enable user to onboard their IDPs and service catalogs tools, and allow the user to bring their application context into AppRisk.
2. Enrich repo assets with metadata from IDPs and service catalogs tools. This will help Security team manage their assets and create policies for their assets using application context metadata.

This improvement is available for AppRisk Essentials and AppRisk Pro customers. Please see our [user docs](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/application-context-for-scm-integrations) for more details, and contact your account team with any questions.

## AppRisk - Improved Edit Integration Profile

July 17, 2024

**Improved**

We're pleased to share the improvement to the Snyk AppRisk - Edit Integration Profile experience.

What are the improvements?

1. For all the integration in AppRisk Integration Hub, we anonymize the credentials when user wants to edit their integration profile. This improvement allows the user to edit their profile without resubmitting the credentials. This improvement is applied to all the integration in the integration hub (SCM, App Context, SAST, Secrets, Runtime )
2. For GitHub integration in AppRisk integration Hub, we allow customers to add wildcards (\*) to their GitHub Org, so we will onboard their GitHub Org that fits with the pattern described with the wildcards.

This improvement is available for AppRisk Essentials and AppRisk Pro customers. Please see our [user docs](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations#wildcard-scm-integration) for more details, and contact your account team with any questions.

## AppRisk Essentials - Improved Asset Inventory filtering

July 9, 2024

**Improved**

We're pleased to share improvements to the **Snyk AppRisk Asset Inventory** filtering experience. These changes are designed to improve the user experience and speed up workflows.

### **What is this feature about?**

With the improved experience, applying a filter will display a flat list of assets that match the criteria directly, without showing them in a hierarchical structure. In addition, the detailed view for assets now includes a list of ‚ÄúRelated Assets‚Äù, the package manifests found in the repository. Similarly, package details now feature a link back to their parent repository.

Finally, we've renamed and reordered the Inventory layouts. These changes not only make the filtering process clearer and less confusing but also significantly improve speed, helping users find the information they need faster.

This feature will be available for AppRisk Essentials and AppRisk Pro customers. Please see our [user docs](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/snyk-apprisk/inventory-for-snyk-apprisk) for more details, and contact your account team with any questions.

## Developer IDE and CLI usage report (GA)

June 28, 2024

**New**

We are excited to announce the new "Developer IDE and CLI usage" report. This report shows the adoption of Snyk's testing in local development, through the IDE plugins, and in using the CLI locally.

Security teams can use this report to leverage where shift left behavior is strong as model behavior to bring to other teams. More powerfully, security folks can identify where teams or individual developers are not adopting Snyk locally to encourage better shift left behavior.

<figure><img src="assets/developer-ide-and-cli-usage-report.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The report is available under the "Change Report" dropdown at the group and organization levels.

Learn more about this report in [Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/reporting/available-snyk-reports#developer-ide-and-cli-usage).

## Mean Time To Resolve Accuracy in Reports

June 27, 2024

**Improved**

We would like to notify on an improvement related to the issues' Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) measurements.

With the current implementation, issue resolutions of under a day are not being counted correctly during MTTR measurements, which leads to a slightly lower MTTR. The planned release will solve it and provide a more accurate MTTR results.

Once the improved logic is released you should expect seeing higher MTTR measurements, which will reflect a more accurate result.

We plan to release this improvement during the week of July 8th. Please reach out to your account team for any questions.

## API end-of-life process starting July 22nd 2024

June 20, 2024

**New**

As part of our continual improvements at Snyk we are releasing new GA REST API endpoints to replace v1 API endpoints as well as beta and/or experimental REST API endpoints (collectively referred to as ‚ÄúSunsetting Endpoints‚Äù). This helps us maintain the performance, stability, and security of the Snyk platform for all customers.

Last year, we performed a major [end-of-life for the v1 List All Project endpoint](https://headwayapp.co/snyk-io-updates/deprecation-and-end-of-life-for-the-list-all-projects-v1-api-267781) and following feedback and learnings from the initiative, we are pleased to announce that we are rolling out an [API end-of-life process](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides) for our v1 endpoints and non-GA REST endpoints. The process aims to provide you with improved predictability, efficiency, and reliability when Snyk is in a position to sunset v1 and non-GA REST endpoints.

v1 and non-GA REST endpoints will be sunsetted across two cadences per year; in January and July (with communication one month prior on which endpoints will be included in an end-of-life cadence).

The timelines for how long migrations last for (based on whether it's a v1 or non-GA REST endpoint) can be found in the [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides), along with the endpoint migration guides, key milestones and dates, and expectations you should have around future API migrations.

The first API end-of-life cadence will begin on **July 22nd 2024**:

### **Deprecated API endpoints**

* [v1 Group and Org audit logs endpoints](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/audit-logs)
* Experimental [Get all Issues by Org](https://apidocs.snyk.io/experimental?version=2023-03-10%7Eexperimental#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/issues) and [Get all Issues by Group](https://apidocs.snyk.io/experimental?version=2023-03-10%7Eexperimental#get-/groups/-group\_id-/issues) endpoints

### **GA REST endpoint(s) replacement(s)**

* GA REST [Group](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-04-29#get-/groups/-group\_id-/audit\_logs/search) and [Org](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-04-29#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/audit\_logs/search) level audit log endpoints
* GA [REST Issues API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/#tag--Issues)

You can read more about the endpoints in this end-of-life cadence in the [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates).

## Improved security prioritization with CVSS version 4.0

June 18, 2024

**New**

We‚Äôre happy to announce the introduction of the latest version of CVSS - version 4.0.

Starting today, and in accordance with the latest official CVSS version published by [FIRST.org](https://first.org), new vulnerabilities will be assigned with hand curated CVSS v4.0 vectors by Snyk‚Äôs team of Security Analysts.

All new advisories identified by Snyk Open Source will be provided with both CVSS v4.0 and CVSS v3.1 severity assessments. These new advisories, which will have a provided CVSS v4.0 vector and score, will determine the default severity of the issue, based on CVSS v4.0. The current severity of existing issues in your projects will not change.

In addition to basing the severity of new issues on CVSS v4.0, Snyk will gradually expose the new vector metrics in the various product workflows.

The new default evaluation using CVSS v4.0 will improve the prioritization workflow and risk assessment, enabling you to focus on the most emerging threats.

For more information about CVSS v4.0's specifications, please refer to the blog post: [What‚Äôs new in CVSS 4.0](https://snyk.io/blog/cvss-4/).

## Snyk Apps UI

June 10, 2024

**New**

[Snyk Apps](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-apps-ga/) are a way to help you integrate Snyk into your workflows, platforms, and tools. As you install more Snyk Apps, you‚Äôll need to be able to observe and manage them easily. You can find out a number of key pieces of information about your Apps through the [API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-05-23#tag--Apps) for your Snyk Apps including:

* Which Snyk Apps have been installed
* When it was installed

To improve security, you can also revoke Snyk Apps through the API to reduce the number of connections you have exposed. However, we‚Äôre aware that not everyone uses the API and that some management actions are more effective through the UI.

We‚Äôre pleased to announce that the next iteration in the Snyk Apps story is to bring all of these management capabilities to the Snyk UI.

<figure><img src="assets/snyk-apps-ui.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you want to read more about Snyk Apps and its new management UI, please visit the [user documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/snyk-apps).

## Important update on Snyk Images: Obsolete software packages

June 7, 2024

**Deprecated**

This is a follow-up to the [previous announcement](https://updates.snyk.io/deprecation-notice-for-obsolete-snyk-images-292563) about Snyk Images containing obsolete software.

Obsolete Snyk Images listed [here](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images) are being discontinued. Snyk customers must stop using them and build their own images following Snyk's [documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/user-defined-custom-images-for-cli).

**Snyk is no longer building a subset of Snyk Images:** As of 10th June 2024, Snyk has stopped building [obsolete images](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images). These images contained software packages that are no longer supported by upstream vendors.

Snyk will not build, maintain, or deploy this subset of Snyk Images and they will be removed from Docker Hub on the 12th of August 2024.

**Action required:** Users of [these images](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images) must replace them by 11th August 2024 to avoid disruption to their CI/CD workflows. This subset is no longer maintained and could be vulnerable to security risks.

Snyk recommends building custom images that meet your needs. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/user-defined-custom-images-for-cli). Alternatively, you can use the latest version of base images listed [here](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/user-defined-custom-images-for-cli).

## API Changelogs are now GA!

May 30, 2024

**New**

Snyk delivers a number of REST API improvements and changes regularly which can be incredibly beneficial. However, given the frequency of delivery, it can be difficult to keep track of these changes at a glance, which means that you might be missing out on key improvements or potentially breaking changes.

With this in mind, we‚Äôre pleased to announce that we have created and exposed a [changelog for our API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/changelog). This changelog will outline which REST endpoints have been affected, what the change was, and whether it‚Äôs breaking. You can also look at the changes per version of the API.

## Snyk Code Improvements: BinaryFormatterUsage Support

May 16, 2024

**New**

We are excited to announce improvements to our Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) rule where we now report on every usage of the BinaryFormatter library. This update specifically addresses the use of the BinaryFormatter class in serialization processes in C# and VB.NET applications.

The rule triggers a warning message: "The BinaryFormatter class was found to be in use. As per Microsoft recommendations, BinaryFormatter serialization is obsolete and should not be used". This is aligned with [Microsoft's guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide) advocating for the discontinuation of obsolete serialization methods due to security risks.

This rule has been updated within the Snyk Code scanning processes and is available for immediate use. Customers may notice a modest increase in identified issues related to this rule when conducting new scans.

Thank you for choosing Snyk Code to enhance the security and integrity of your software development. We are committed to continuously improving our tools to help you keep your code safe and efficient.

Snyk Images are [published](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file) by Snyk covering a range of different software versions and operating systems in common usage. These images can be pulled from Docker Hub [snyk/snyk](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk).

We have identified [a list of Snyk Images](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images) which are built on software packages that are no longer supported by their upstream vendors. To ensure our customers stay secure, we will stop building images based on unsupported software, followed by a removal of these images from Docker Hub.

Here are the steps that we will take in the next four months:

* Stop building Snyk Images that are listed [here](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images) on the 10th of June 2024
* Remove them from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk) on the 12th of August 2024

Snyk strongly recommends customers to check [this](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#vendor-unsupported-base-images) list and to stop using listed images as they pose security risks. To transition away from these images, please follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images?tab=readme-ov-file#including-snyk-in-your-own-images).

Snyk will be removing obsolete Snyk Images from Docker Hub on the 12th of August 2024. Customers who continue using Snyk Images that Snyk does not recommend will observe broken build pipelines or disruption to their integrated workflows after the 11th of August 2024.

## Deprecation notice for Snyk CLI Images

May 10, 2024

**Deprecated**

We would like to inform Snyk customers that Snyk CLI Images will be removed from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-cli) on the 12th of August 2024. We advise customers to transition away from these images as a matter of urgency.

Snyk CLI Images are docker images that bundle CLI binaries along with commonly used software versions and operating systems. In 2022, Snyk shared a deprecation notice on Docker Hub recommending customers to not use them. In October 2023, we also announced the decoupling of [Snyk Orb](https://updates.snyk.io/decoupling-snyk-orb-from-snyk-cli-docker-images-277506), and [Snyk Scan](https://updates.snyk.io/decoupling-snyk-scan-from-snyk-cli-docker-images-277502) from Snyk CLI Images.

Since these changes, Snyk strongly recommends that customers stop using these images for the following reasons: These images contain software packages which are no longer supported by their upstream vendors Unsupported packages pose security risks Snyk stopped maintaining these images in October 2023

Snyk will be removing these deprecated images from Docker Hub on the 12th of August 2024. Customers who continue using Snyk CLI Images after 11th of August 2024 will observe broken build pipelines or disruption to their integrated workflows. To transition away from these images, please follow product documentation [here](https://docs.snyk.io/integrate-with-snyk/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/bitbucket-pipelines-integration-using-a-snyk-pipe/user-defined-custom-images) to build your own custom images.

## Snyk Code Improvements: Support for LLM Sources

May 1, 2024

**Improved**

As adoption of LLM platforms like OpenAI and Gemini grows, so does the security risk associated with using them. We‚Äôve added LLM sources to our ruleset which means the taint vulnerabilities supported by Snyk Code will now report when untrusted data from an LLM reaches a sensitive function. This greatly expands our coverage in the fast growing AI domain across all of our supported languages.

We are committed to enabling our customers to securely leverage cutting edge AI tools and libraries. Our analysts will continue to research this topic in detail, and we will periodically publish this research in our blog. You can read the latest post on [code injection vulnerabilities in Python caused by Generative AI](https://snyk.io/blog/code-injection-vulnerabilities-caused-by-generative-ai/).

If you have any questions, or want a detailed list of LLM libraries added, please reach out to your account teams.

## Filter through your audit logs more efficiently with the new GA REST version of the audit logs API, and api.access is now opt-in

April 30, 2024

**New**, **Improved**

We've made some great new improvements to our existing GA REST audit log API to help you filter and find the logs you need more efficiently:

1. **Filter over time** - Previously, users faced challenges filtering audit logs due to the smallest unit being within a day. This difficulty escalates for users who may need to sift through millions of logs to find specific events. Now, by expanding filtering options to larger time periods and reducing the minimum granularity to 1-second ranges, customers can broaden their search while pinpointing crucial audit events like security breaches or for external audits.
2. **Exclude events** - some users can have millions of audit logs being produced every day so they need the ability to exclude certain events to reduce the noise of what they have to sieve through. We already have exclude events in the API today but you can only provide 1 include or exclude event, so we‚Äôve improved this by providing multiple include and exclude events.

For more information, check out the [API documentation](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-04-29#get-/groups/-group\_id-/audit\_logs/search), and we hope you update your version and enjoy these new improvements soon!

In addition, we are making `api.access` endpoint to be opt-in for users rather than automatically returning results due to feedback that `api.access` causes noise problems. We‚Äôre actively working towards a proper audit event for actions.

## Test an SBOM using the Snyk CLI

April 19, 2024

**Early Access**

We are very pleased to announce that you can now use the Snyk CLI to scan CycloneDX and SPDX SBOM files!

Snyk has enabled SBOM testing [via the API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-08-31\~beta#post-/orgs/-org\_id-/sbom\_tests) for a while. Adding this to the CLI makes it significantly easier to test SBOMs produced using other tools, or SBOMs received from 3rd-party vendors.

To get started install Snyk CLI [v1.1290](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1290.0) or above, and run the following command (using your actual SBOM file name üòâ).

```bash
snyk sbom test --experimental --file=bom.cdx.json
```

This feature is in Open Beta, the following SBOM formats are currently supported.

* CycloneDX: JSON version 1.4 and 1.5
* SPDX: JSON version 2.3

## Configurable Python version in Snyk Open Source SCM scans is now GA!

April 3, 2024

**New**

We are very pleased to announce that the option to define Python minor version when scanning pip projects via Git integrations is now GA!

Until now, Snyk would always use either Python 2.7 or 3.7 which could lead to some dependencies being omitted from results if they require newer versions.

You can now specify minor versions of Python 3 to use in scans, up to 3.12.

To try this out go to Settings > Languages > Python and specify the Python version to use.

For more details see the documentation [available here](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-using-snyk/supported-languages-and-frameworks/python#pip-and-python-versions).

## License issues alignment in reporting

February 29, 2024

**Improved**

In about a week, Snyk will update the logic for **counting license issues** in both Reports and Enterprise Analytics pages to better align with the way license issues are counted in Snyk projects page and Issues API. This will provide customers with a more consistent user experience across Snyk platform and ensure that license issue counts received from different Snyk interfaces are aligned. Customers using Snyk Open Source will see fewer issues in reporting once this change is applied, as the paths by which an issue is introduced will no longer be counted separately. Please reach out to your account team with any questions.

## New CWE TOP 10 KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) Report

February 26, 2024

**New**

We are happy to share the availability of a new report - **CWE TOP 10 KEV** (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities).

**CISA**:

* In 2021, the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cybersecurity-division) began publishing the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).
* The CVEs in this catalog are vulnerabilities reported as actively exploited. CISA recommends that organizations monitor the KEV catalog and use its content to help prioritize remediation activities in their systems to reduce the likelihood of compromise.

**The new KEV report**:

* In December 2023, MITRE published an analysis of the TOP 10 exploitable CWEs for the first time. For each CWE, MITRE looked at how many CVEs are assigned to it in the KEV catalog and their average CVSS score.
* The list contains [10 prioritized CWEs](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023\_kev\_list.html) that, if addressed, can reduce the risk of exploitation.

The new report provides an additional approach to managing and prioritizing risk according to industry standards in addition to the OWASP TOP 10 (2021) and the CWE TOP 25 (2023) reports.

## Targets API endpoint release to GA!

February 26, 2024

**New**, **Deprecated**

Following the release of the [Targets API beta](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-01-04\~beta#tag--Targets), we were given feedback that users had some issues with the naming conventions, would like to see the prefix updated to be consistent with standards used in other endpoints, and we were also given feedback that we‚Äôre missing various fields and filters which were supported in other versions of the API (including via the projects API).

With that, we're proud to announce that we've taken that feedback on board, addressed the points, and have released the [GA version of the Targets API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-02-21#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/targets)!

With the GA release of any API in Snyk, the GA release of this endpoint (which is a huge improvement on the beta) means the beta version is automatically deprecated, and users are highly recommended to upgrade to the GA version as soon as possible.

We are not removing the beta endpoint yet, and you can still continue using it.

However, after 90 days, we can remove the API endpoint. We will communicate regularly that the GA endpoint is available to upgrade to, and that we will remove the endpoint as we approach the time.

When we remove the beta API, you will be greeted by an `http 404 error`, and the simple fix is to upgrade to the latest version.

## Snyk CLI Improvement: Auth tokens redacted

January 8, 2024

**Improved**

With our customers and users security in mind, from version [v1.1268.0](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1268.0) onwards, [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli) will redact [Snyk API authentication tokens](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/how-to-obtain-and-authenticate-with-your-snyk-api-token) from its [debug](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands#debug) logs.

Once upgraded, when Snyk users run the following commands to enable Snyk CLI debug logs,

`DEBUG=* snyk test -d`

or

`DEBUG=snyk* snyk test -d`

they will see API authentication redacted and displayed as `***`.

An example of this change is inline:

Snyk API authentication tokens will be redacted from Snyk CLI debug logs for both [service](https://docs.snyk.io/enterprise-setup/service-accounts) as well as individual Snyk accounts.

We recommend upgrading to [v1.1268.0](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.1268.0) to benefit from this change.
