## Improved CLI authentication & token management

December 20, 2019

**Improved**

We’ve improved our CLI authentication by introducing two important new security features: The CLI authentication process is now followed by a new approval webpage, designed to provide better user visibility and to protect against CSRF attacks. Read about authentication in [our docs](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003812458-Getting-started-with-the-CLI).

We’ve also added the ability to revoke and regenerate your personal API token from Account Settings. To learn more about this feature, [check out this article](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004008278-Revoke-token).

We would like to credit and thank [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://twitter.com/JLLeitschuh) and [Eran Lipkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eranlip) for independently reporting the CSRF issue to us via [our Bug Bounty program](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360005918418-Snyk-vulnerability-disclosure-program).

## Prioritize vulnerabilities quickly with our Exploit Maturity filter

November 21, 2019

**New**

Thanks to our diligent Security teams, Snyk is happy to release our new _Exploit Maturity_ filter from the _Projects_ and the _Reports_ areas as well as through our API. Using exploits in the wild as a rule of thumb for fast prioritization will bring you to the finish line seamlessly. Read more about our approach from [our blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/whats-so-wild-about-exploits-in-the-wild-and-how-can-we-prioritize-accordingly/), and more about the filter for the app in [our docs](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004002678-Evaluate-and-prioritize-vulnerabilities).

## Snyk now integrates directly with Kubernetes

November 12, 2019

**New**

You can now use Snyk to gather data about applications running in your Kubernetes clusters. Import the workloads you are interested in and we'll analyse them for vulnerabilities and detect issues with the configuration which might increase the risk of an exploit.

This new integration is only available to Snyk Container customers, including existing Docker add-on customers. Find out more in the [blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/secure-your-kubernetes-applications-with-snyk-container/) or jump straight into the [documentation](https://snyk.io/docs/kubernetes-integration-overview/).

## Our Snyk CLI tool now supports CocoaPods!

November 7, 2019

**New**

Test and monitor your CocoaPods projects from our Snyk CLI tool now with `snyk test` and `snyk monitor`. Available in all CLI versions from v1.230.8.

## Project owner metadata

October 18, 2019

**New**

We now give you the ability to add a project owner inside each individual project page in the UI, or using the API. You can add anyone as a project owner who has access to the org that the project is in.

To try this out, go to any project page and in the metadata header, you now have the option to assign a project owner from a list of everyone who has access to the project.

At the moment, this data is only for reference, but we have plans to use it in other areas of Snyk in the future.

***

## More improved APIs served up just for you!

October 17, 2019

**Improved**

The API **list all dependencies** endpoint now includes `issuesHigh`, `issuesMedium` and `issuesLow` fields for each license, displaying the number of issues in the dependency per severity level.

You can now filter for only dependencies that contain at least one issue of each severity. Use the `severity` filter to do this. See [our docs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/dependencies/dependencies-by-organization/list-all-dependencies) for more information.

## Deep manifest file search now available, and more!

August 4, 2019

**New**

From now on, you don’t need to ensure your manifest file is on the root level, and you don’t have to tell us where it is either. For GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Cloud and Azure Repos, we now search the entire depth of your project to find and analyze the manifest files for your application when importing projects to Snyk.

To get started:

* for Broker, upgrade to at least v 4.53.0
* for projects Snyk is already monitoring, re-import.

When importing (or re-importing), use the Exclude folders field if you don't want Snyk looking through certain parts of the project.

Plus! We’ve updated our GitLab integration settings screen, making it easier than ever to onboard, integrate and import your GitLab projects for security scanning, fixing and monitoring. Log out and back in to get started.
