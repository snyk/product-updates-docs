## Import Go Modules projects from Git

December 15, 2020

**Open Beta**

We are pleased to announce that we are releasing support for importing Go Modules project from Git repos!

We have supported Go Modules in the Snyk CLI for some time, but the ability to import directly from a Git repo has been one of our most popular feature requests.

This feature is in open beta and we'll be gradually making it available to Snyk users over the next few weeks. If you can't wait and want to get access sooner, reach out to support@snyk.io.

## Understand Container vulnerabilities with Relative Importance

December 15, 2020

**New**

Container vulnerabilities are tricky things to deal with, requiring an understanding of both Linux security and container image architecture. We‚Äôre pleased to announce a new feature that helps take some of the mystery out of prioritising and fixing container vulnerabilities: relative importance.

Snyk now surfaces the different sources that were considered when determining a Linux Container severity.

[Read more](https://snyk.io/blog/container-linux-security-and-relative-importance/) about relative importance, and our general Linux Container Security story!

## Bug fix: Fixable issues in Reporting

December 2, 2020

**Fix**

Tomorrow at 9 AM EST, we will push a bug fix that may impact the count of fixable issues in the grouped view of the Issues tab within reporting.

This fix corrects a mistake in aggregation that incorrectly marked entire issue groups as not fixable if some issues in that group were not fixable. These issue groups will now be marked as fixable, as some issues within the group are fixable.

## Prioritize your vulnerabilities with our new Security Policies

November 18, 2020

**New**

We're pleased to announce the general availability of Security Policies - enabling security teams to create rules to automatically prioritize or de-prioritize specific vulnerabilities, and ensuring developers can easily understand which vulnerabilities should be tackled first.

This is just the beginning for Security Policies! We will be adding more conditions and actions over time to give you even more control over what your developers see.

More information about how Security Policies can help with prioritization is available on [our blog](https://snyk.io/blog/snyks-developer-first-prioritization-capabilities/). To learn more about how to use this capability, check out [our help center documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360014568658-Getting-started-Security-policies).

Security Policies is available for Pro and Enterprise users.

## Dockerfile vulnerabilities detection directly from Git

November 11, 2020

**New**

We're thrilled to announce that Snyk now detects Dockerfiles directly from your source code manager and surfaces base image vulnerabilities.

This allows you to identify issues before building the container image, and fix them before they land in registry or production based on our base image recommendations.

To get started, import your Git repository (where your Dockerfile lies) and check out the new Dockerfile project created. There, you can see all the relevant information to start taking action, including base image vulnerabilities, base image recommendations and the option to link the Dockerfile project to other image projects you have in Snyk.

## Filtering projects by tags in the UI

October 14, 2020

**New**

We recently released the ability to be able to group projects in the UI with the use of project tags, so you can work with projects at scale. Today, we're thrilled to announce that you can filter projects by those tags in the project listing page - you can now easily find that needle of a project in your haystack!

You can filter by tags and attributes at the same time, so you can organise your system however you please!

You can read more about how to scale successfully with Snyk in our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/how-to-scale-successfully-with-snyk/), and you can learn more about project tagging by visiting our [API docs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/project-tags) and [Knowledge Centre](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360013865038).

***

## Project Tags

September 30, 2020

**New**

Identifying the right projects to work on at the right time can quickly become unmanageable when you scale from dozens to hundreds, or even thousands. Ensuring that your teams are working as efficiently as possible can let them focus on fixing issues rather than finding what they should be working on ‚Äî you need to be able to find a needle in this haystack!

It‚Äôs with great pleasure that we can announce the latest feature to improve management at scale: Project tags. With Project tags, you can organize and locate your projects by tagging them based on any criteria that you have. Whether it‚Äôs grouping projects by team, the applications they are part of, or the potential risk they have in your system, you can organize and prioritize your work how you like.

You can read more about how to scale successfully with Snyk in our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/how-to-scale-successfully-with-snyk/), and you can learn more about project tagging by visiting our [API docs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/project-tags) and [Knowledge Centre](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360013865038).

***

## Non-SPDX licenses support

September 23, 2020

**New**

Happy to share that Snyk licenses support has been extended to include non-SPDX licenses. By default, newly added licenses will inherit the ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù license severity, which can be later updated at the settings area.

In order to be alerted, in cases where those licenses were used in any of your projects, verify that the severity level is not set to ‚ÄúNone‚Äù.

## Signed Commits for Fix and Upgrade PRs in GitHub

September 7, 2020

**New**

One of Snyk‚Äôs most powerful features is the ability to open fix and upgrade pull requests, directly in the SCM, making it easy for developers to fix vulnerabilities in their repos and keep the dependencies up to date in one click.

From now on, all of our PRs in GitHub (both fix and upgrade) will be signed with a PGP key, providing developers the confidence that Snyk's fix and upgrade PRs are generated by a trusted source üéâ

***

## Project Header refresh and Project Attributes

September 3, 2020

**New**

If you look closely we‚Äôve given the project page a makeover; we‚Äôve not taken anything away from the page, we‚Äôve just moved things around to help improve the user experience. This is to help cater for project attributes, which are static and non-configurable fields on projects which allow you to add additional metadata (also known as ‚Äúvalues‚Äù) to a project.

The values added to a project can be used to group, organise, and filter projects in Snyk so that you can work efficiently and effectively prioritise what needs to be worked on. You can apply values to projects through the UI and through the API.

To learn more about project attributes, visit our [API docs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/reference/projects/project-attributes) and [Knowledge Center](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360012703537-Project-Attributes).

***

## Improved PR Tests logic

August 27, 2020

**Improved**

We‚Äôre happy to share that we‚Äôve improved our PR Tests logic!

When Snyk cannot find in the tested pull request a manifest file that is being monitored, it will now skip its test instead of failing it, so the PR check will show as successful.

This change allows to keep the repositories you monitor with Snyk secured, by testing new pull requests for vulnerabilities and license issues, while allowing developers to get more accurate PR tests results.

***

## Opening fix and upgrade pull requests from a fixed GitHub account

August 17, 2020

## Combined status checks for pull request tests

March 5, 2020

**New**

We've just released a new enhancement to our PR tests feature! In the next few days, instead of receiving a status check per project (manifest) file, you'll receive only two combined status checks for the project in the repository: one for security and one for licenses.

When you click on the Details link, you‚Äôll reach a page in Snyk showing a list of tests with a per-project status drill down. This feature is great for mono-repos, allowing you to see a reduced number of status checks coming from Snyk.

<details>

<summary>Have GitHub repos where Snyk checks are marked as <em>Required</em>?</summary>

If Snyk checks are marked as _Required_ in your GitHub repository settings, you'll need to swap the Required checks settings to the new combined checks (to look for the generic "security/snyk" check, instead of "security/snyk - \<MANIFEST\_FILE>").

In order to avoid blocking your work, we added detailed migration instructions that allow you to start the migration whenever you're ready. You can find the instructions in the Organization Settings page --> Integrations --> GitHub.

</details>

January 9, 2020

**Improved**

Snyk now goes beyond NVD to bring distro-specific severities for our Linux vulnerabilities. With this change, even when a vulnerability is considered to be a high-severity issue in the most general context, it might still be a lower severity issue in specific Linux distros such as Debian or Ubuntu (or others).
